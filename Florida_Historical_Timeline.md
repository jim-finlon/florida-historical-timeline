# A Comprehensive History of Florida: From Pre-Columbian Era to 2000

## An Academic Research Timeline

---

# Part I: Pre-Columbian Florida (Before 1513)

## Native American Tribes and Cultures

Before European contact, approximately 350,000 Native Americans inhabited Florida. The major tribal groups developed unique cultures adapted to Florida's diverse ecosystems.

### The Timucua
- **Location:** Northeastern and north-central Florida
- **Population:** Estimated 200,000, forming the largest and most complex society in pre-Columbian Florida
- **Society:** Composed of numerous autonomous provinces, often hostile to one another
- **Economy:** Hunting (bears, deer, wild turkey, alligators, fish, clams, oysters) and agriculture (maize, beans, squash, pumpkins, melons)
- **Social Organization:** Clan-based, matrilineal society with male village leaders

### The Apalachee
- **Location:** Florida Panhandle, between the Ochlockonee and Aucilla rivers near present-day Tallahassee
- **Significance:** One of the most powerful and influential native groups in Florida
- **Economy:** Agricultural prowess, cultivating maize, beans, and squash in fertile soils
- **Status:** Regarded by other Florida Indians as wealthy and fierce
- **Timeline:** Established from at least A.D. 1000

### The Calusa
- **Location:** Southwest coast of Florida, along inland waterways and the Caloosahatchee River
- **Name Origin:** Originally called "Calos" meaning "Fierce People"
- **Ancestry:** Descendants of Paleo-Indians who inhabited Southwest Florida approximately 12,000 years ago
- **Society:** Vast domain ruled by a single chief; elaborate political, social, and trade networks despite lacking agriculture
- **Notable:** Excellent seamen who traveled as far as Cuba in hollowed-out cypress log canoes
- **Historical Significance:** Responsible for wounding Juan Ponce de León in 1521, causing his death

### Other Notable Tribes
- **Tequesta:** South Florida
- **Tocobaga:** Tampa Bay area

# Part II: Age of Discovery and Spanish Exploration (1513-1565)

## 1513 - Discovery of Florida

### Juan Ponce de León's First Expedition
- **Date:** March 4, 1513 - Ponce de León equipped three ships with at least 200 men at his own expense, departing from Puerto Rico
- **First Sighting:** March 27, 1513 - Saw the mainland of Florida, believing it to be an island
- **Navigation Record:** April 2, 1513 - Navigator Antón de Alaminos recorded their location at 30°8' N latitude, just south of present-day Ponte Vedra Beach
- **Landing:** Between April 2-8, 1513 - Ponce de León waded ashore on the northeast coast, possibly near present-day St. Augustine
- **Claiming the Land:** April 8, 1513 - In the name of the Spanish king, Ponce de León took possession of "La Florida"

### Origin of the Name "Florida"
The peninsula was named "La Florida" for two reasons:
1. Discovery came during Easter (Pascua Florida - "Feast of Flowers")
2. According to historian Antonio de Herrera: "because it had a very pretty view of many cool woodlands, and it was level and uniform"

### Exploration of the Coast
- Explored the coast including the Florida Keys
- Discovered the Gulf Stream
- Entered Charlotte Harbor area on the west coast
- Encountered the hostile Calusa tribe at Mound Key

### The Fountain of Youth Myth
No contemporary evidence supports the popular story that Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth. Modern historians consider this a later myth.

### Note on Earlier Contact
Ponce de León almost certainly was not the first European to reach Florida:
- Spanish slave expeditions had been raiding the Bahamas since 1494
- The Cantino Map of 1502 shows a peninsula near Cuba resembling Florida

## 1521 - Ponce de León's Second Expedition and Death

- Ponce de León returned to establish a colony
- Landed on gulf beaches between Charlotte Harbor and Estero Bay
- Brought over 200 settlers, horses, tools, and seeds
- Ambushed by Calusa while seeking fresh water
- Shot in the thigh by an arrow
- Settlers abandoned the settlement and sailed to Cuba
- Ponce de León died from his wound at age 61 in Cuba

## Other Early Spanish Expeditions

| Year | Explorer | Expedition Details |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| 1527 | Pánfilo de Narváez | Landed near Tampa Bay |
| 1539 | Hernando de Soto | Major expedition through Florida and the Southeast |
| 1559 | Tristán de Luna | Attempted settlement at Pensacola (failed) |

# Part III: French Florida and the Founding of St. Augustine (1562-1565)

## French Huguenot Colonization Efforts

### Background
- French Huguenot leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny envisioned New World colonies as a haven for persecuted Protestants
- Part of broader French colonial effort known as "French Florida" or "La Floride Française"

### 1562 - Jean Ribault's First Expedition
- **May 1562:** French expedition led by Jean Ribault landed at the May River (now St. Johns River)
- Ribault established Charlesfort on present-day Parris Island, South Carolina
- Ribault captured and imprisoned in England on suspicion of spying
- Without supplies or leadership, colonists abandoned Charlesfort after one year

### 1564 - Establishment of Fort Caroline
- **June 22, 1564:** René Goulaine de Laudonnière (Ribault's former second-in-command) led approximately 200 settlers back to Florida
- Founded Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River near present-day Jacksonville
- Named for King Charles IX of France
- Colony included soldiers, tailors, brewers, an artist, a physician, and an astronomer (not all were Huguenots; some were Roman Catholics)
- Local Timucua initially assisted in building the fort

## 1565 - Spanish Response and the Founding of St. Augustine

### Spanish Alarm
- King Philip II outraged that French Huguenots (Protestants) had settled in territory Spain claimed
- Dispatched fleet of eleven ships with 1,000 soldiers and settlers
- General Pedro Menéndez de Avilés charged with removing the French and establishing Spanish colony

### Founding of St. Augustine
- **August 28, 1565:** Menéndez's ships first sighted land on the feast day of St. Augustine of Hippo
- Named the settlement "San Agustín" in honor of the patron saint of his hometown of Avilés, Spain
- **September 1565:** Spanish colonists established settlement at Seloy's Timucua town

### St. Augustine's Significance
- First permanent European city in what is now the United States
- Established 42 years before Jamestown, Virginia (1607)
- Established 55 years before Plymouth Rock (1620)

### The Massacre of the Huguenots
- Brief skirmish between Ribault's and Menéndez's ships
- Spanish retreated 35 miles south to establish St. Augustine
- Menéndez attacked and captured Fort Caroline
- Executed Jean Ribault and several hundred Huguenots as heretics at Matanzas Inlet
- "Matanzas" is Spanish for "slaughters"
- The atrocity shocked Europeans even in that era of religious strife

---

# Part IV: First Spanish Colonial Period (1565-1763)

## Early Colonial Life in St. Augustine

### First Years (1565-1566)
- Spanish colonists made settlement at Seloy's Timucua town
- Fought and expelled remaining French settlers
- Converted Seloy's council house into a fort
- Used St. Augustine as base for exploration
- Relations with Timucua deteriorated quickly
- By May 1566, moved across St. Augustine bay to Anastasia Island

### Notable Firsts
- **1566:** Martín de Argüelles born in St. Augustine—first recorded birth of a child of European ancestry in continental United States (21 years before Roanoke, 42 years before Jamestown)

### Colonial Demographics
By the end of the 16th century, St. Augustine's population included:
- Criollos (people of Spanish descent born in America)
- Indigenous peoples
- Africans
- People of multiracial parentage

### Economy and Sustenance
- Economy supported by the *situado* (Spanish government subsidy)
- Funds used for salaries, food, clothing, and weapons
- *Situado* often failed to arrive regularly
- Residents relied mainly on local food sources

## The Spanish Mission System (16th-18th Centuries)

### Scope and Development
- St. Augustine served as military, administrative, and religious headquarters
- Franciscan friars established missions among native populations
- Between 1526 and 1704: at least 146 missions, mission centers, and native villages established
  - 128 in present-day Florida
  - 18 on the Georgia coast

### Target Populations
- Timucua
- Mocama
- Guale
- Apalachee

## Challenges and Conflicts

### 1668 - English Pirate Attack
- English privateer Robert Searle attacked and plundered St. Augustine

### 1672-1695 - Construction of Castillo de San Marcos
- In response to Searle's raid, Spanish began construction of more secure fortification
- Construction took 25 years
- Today: oldest masonry fort in the continental United States

### Decline of Native Populations
- European arrival brought disease, decimating native populations
- Between 1685-1708: Yamassee and Creek Indians from the north, along with English colonists from Carolina, staged devastating raids against Timucua and Apalachee missions
- By end of 17th century: fewer than 12,000 Timucua and Apalachee remained in missions
- **1763:** When Spain ceded Florida to Britain, only 89 Indians remained—they left for Cuba with the departing Spanish. These were the last of Florida's original indigenous peoples

# Part V: The Golden Age of Piracy in Florida (c. 1650-1730)

## Overview

The Golden Age of Piracy (late 17th to early 18th century) significantly impacted Florida due to its strategic location between the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean.

### Florida's Appeal to Pirates
- Hidden coves and secluded islands
- Prime location for preying on merchant vessels
- Trade routes from Spanish Main passed through Florida waters

## Notable Pirates in Florida Waters

### Edward Teach (Blackbeard)
- **Career:** Only 15 months of active piracy, yet legendary status
- **Tactics:** Wove hemp into his iconic beard and set it on fire to terrorize opponents
- **1717:** Captured French ship *La Concorde*, renamed it *Queen Anne's Revenge*
- **Operations:** Active in Florida Straits and along North American East Coast
- **End:** Briefly accepted pardon, lived in North Carolina as semi-retired pirate; killed in hand-to-hand combat during raid by Lt. Robert Maynard

### Other Pirates Active in Florida Waters
- **Calico Jack Rackham:** Operated in Florida waters
- **Anne Bonny:** Female pirate who frequented Florida
- **Various buccaneers and privateers:** Used Florida's coastline for operations

## José Gaspar (Gasparilla) - Legend and Reality

### The Legend
- Also known as "Gasparilla"
- Supposedly lived c. 1756-1821
- Allegedly terrorized Gulf of Mexico from base in southwest Florida during Second Spanish Period (1783-1821)

### Historical Reality
- **No evidence José Gaspar existed**
- No contemporary mention in Spanish or American ship logs, court records, newspapers, or archives
- Earliest written mention: early 20th century promotional brochure for Gasparilla Inn on Gasparilla Island at Charlotte Harbor
- Author admitted it was fiction "without a true fact in it"
- Timeline inconsistent: alleged career was after the Golden Age of Piracy when major pirates had been eliminated

### The Gasparilla Festival
- **1904:** Louise Frances Dodge (Tampa newspaper society editor) and George W. Hardee organized first festival
- Inspired by success of Mardi Gras in New Orleans
- Goal: Turn Tampa into tourist destination
- Continues today as annual Tampa tradition with pirate ship "invasion" and parade

### Diverse Population
- More than half of St. Augustine's population: English, Minorcan, and newly-American families
- Attracted settlers from United States with Spanish land grants
- Promise of freedom for escaped slaves drew runaways

## Free Black Communities and Slavery

### Spanish Approach to Slavery
- Spanish government did not view slavery as permanent state

# Part IX: The Seminole Wars (1817-1858)

## Overview

The Seminole Wars (also known as the Florida Wars) were three military conflicts between the United States and the Seminole people, arising from U.S. policies aimed at relocating Native Americans from ancestral lands east of the Mississippi River.

## First Seminole War (1817-1818)

- First state director: Thomas W. Osborn
- Osborn respected for massive food relief program

### Challenges
- Most homesteads on poor soil previously abandoned by white farmers
- By 1866, most freed slaves were tenant farmers on former masters' plantations
- Rural African Americans found limited opportunities: tenant farming, sharecropping, jobs on white estates

## End of Reconstruction

### Compromise of 1877
- Resolved disputed 1876 presidential election
- Republican Rutherford B. Hayes awarded electoral votes of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina
- In return, all federal troops removed from the South
- **By 1876:** Only South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana remained under Republican control
- Remaining Southern states had been "redeemed" by white Democrats

### Labor Practices
- Throughout 1880s-1890s, extensively employed convict labor
- Primarily African-American convicts
- Florida's convict lease system considered "especially violent" compared to other states

## The Overseas Railroad to Key West (1905-1912)

### Motivation
- **1905:** U.S. announced construction of Panama Canal
- Key West: closest deep-water U.S. port to the Canal
- Potential for Cuban, Latin American, and West Coast trade
- Key West had population of nearly 20,000, located 128 miles beyond Florida peninsula

### Construction
- **Began:** 1904 under supervision of Joseph C. Meredith
- **After Meredith's death (1909):** William J. Krome guided project

- Workers battled insects, intense heat, food and water shortages
- Required many engineering innovations
- **Cost:** Estimated $50 million

### Completion
- **January 22, 1912:** Overseas Railroad completed
- Flagler (age 82) greeted by thousands of well-wishers
- Citizens of Key West presented Flagler with mounted silver medallions made by Tiffany & Co.
