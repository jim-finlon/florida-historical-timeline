# The Barnacle: Ralph Middleton Munroe's Coconut Grove
## 1891-Present

---

## Overview

The Barnacle is the oldest house in its original location in Miami-Dade County—a remarkable wooden home built in 1891 by yacht designer and Coconut Grove pioneer Ralph Middleton Munroe. More than just a historic house, The Barnacle represents a philosophy of living in harmony with the Florida environment, featuring innovative design that used natural ventilation before air conditioning, sustainable materials, and a deep respect for the subtropical landscape. Munroe was the founder of Coconut Grove's intellectual and bohemian community, and his home became the center of a unique village that valued nature, boats, and civilized conversation over wealth and ostentation.
