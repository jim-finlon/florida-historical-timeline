# The 2000 Presidential Election Recount
## November-December 2000: When Florida Decided America

---

## Overview

The 2000 presidential election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore came down to Florida—and stayed there for 36 agonizing days. On election night, the race was too close to call; the margin eventually settled at fewer than 600 votes out of nearly 6 million cast. What followed was an extraordinary legal and political battle involving hanging chads, butterfly ballots, and ultimately the United States Supreme Court. On December 12, 2000, the Court's 5-4 decision in *Bush v. Gore* stopped the recount, effectively awarding Florida's 25 electoral votes—and the presidency—to George W. Bush. The Florida recount exposed the fragility of American electoral systems and changed how the nation thinks about voting.
