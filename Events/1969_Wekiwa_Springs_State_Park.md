# Wekiwa Springs State Park: Orlando's Natural Oasis
## 1941-Present

---

## Overview

Wekiwa Springs State Park, located just 20 miles north of downtown Orlando, preserves 7,000 acres of natural Florida—ancient springs, river corridors, sandhill habitat, and pine flatwoods—in the heart of one of America's fastest-growing metropolitan areas. The park's centerpiece, Wekiwa Springs, pumps 42 million gallons of crystal-clear 72°F water daily, creating a natural swimming hole that has refreshed visitors for generations. The Wekiva River, born from the springs, winds through pristine wilderness protected as Florida's first Wild and Scenic River. Wekiwa stands as proof that even in heavily developed Central Florida, wild nature can survive—and thrive—when protected.
