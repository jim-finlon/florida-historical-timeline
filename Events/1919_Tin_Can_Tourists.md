# The Tin Can Tourists: America's First RV Travelers
## 1919-Present

---

## Overview

In the winter of 1919, a group of automobile campers gathered in Tampa, Florida, and formed the Tin Can Tourists of the World—one of the first organizations of recreational vehicle travelers in America. Named for the tin cans they used to cook meals, display as membership badges, and the tinned goods that sustained them on the road, these pioneers created a community of like-minded travelers who drove their cars and camping trailers to Florida each winter. At their peak in the 1930s, the Tin Can Tourists had over 100,000 members and established camps throughout Florida. They pioneered auto-tourism, invented the modern campground, and helped establish Florida as a destination for ordinary Americans, not just the wealthy.
