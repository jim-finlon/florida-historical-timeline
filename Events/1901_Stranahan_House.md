# The Stranahan House: Fort Lauderdale's Founding Family
## 1901-Present

---

## Overview

Before Fort Lauderdale existed as a city, Frank Stranahan ran a trading post on the New River, trading with the Seminole Indians and ferrying travelers across the water. The house he built in 1901—later expanded in 1913—is the oldest surviving structure in Fort Lauderdale and tells the story of how Southeast Florida transformed from Seminole wilderness to tourist destination. Frank and his wife Ivy, a pioneering teacher, were central figures in Fort Lauderdale's early history, their lives intertwined with the Seminoles, the railroad, and the town's development. Today, the Stranahan House is a museum that preserves their complex legacy.
