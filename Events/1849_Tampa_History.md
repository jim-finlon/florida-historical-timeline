# Tampa: Cigar City to Modern Metropolis
## 1849-Present

---

## Overview

Tampa, perched on the shores of Hillsborough Bay where the Hillsborough River meets Tampa Bay, has evolved from a small military outpost into Florida's third-largest city and the economic hub of the Gulf Coast. Its story weaves together Spanish explorers, Seminole conflicts, cigar industry immigrants, Gilded Age visionaries, and modern corporate giants. From Fort Brooke to Ybor City, from the Tampa Bay Hotel to the modern skyline, Tampa represents Florida's transformation from frontier territory to global business center—all while maintaining the multicultural character that Cuban, Italian, and Spanish immigrants gave it over a century ago.
