# Haitian Immigration to Florida: The Voyage to Freedom
## 1980-Present

---

## Overview

Haitian immigration to Florida, particularly the dramatic boat arrivals of the 1980s and beyond, brought thousands of refugees fleeing political persecution and economic desperation in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. Unlike their Cuban counterparts who generally received immediate legal status, Haitian refugees faced decades of discriminatory treatment, detention, and deportation while building vibrant communities centered in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood. The Haitian experience in Florida reflects both America's complex immigration policies and the resilience of a people who have enriched Florida's cultural tapestry despite facing tremendous obstacles.
