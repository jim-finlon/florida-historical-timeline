# John James Audubon in Florida: Painting the Birds
## 1831-1832

---

## Overview

In the winter of 1831-1832, America's most famous naturalist-artist John James Audubon traveled to Florida to find birds for his monumental work *The Birds of America*. Landing in St. Augustine and traveling down the St. Johns River to the Keys, Audubon documented and painted dozens of Florida species, many for the first time. He marveled at the flocks of flamingos, wading birds, and raptors, even as he shot hundreds of specimens to use as models. His Florida expedition produced some of his most famous plates and some of his most troubling passages—descriptions of killing birds by the hundreds that helped spark the conservation movement his work would later inspire.
