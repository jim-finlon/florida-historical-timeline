# Orlando Museum of Art: Central Florida's Art Destination
## 1924-Present

---

## Overview

The Orlando Museum of Art (OMA), established in 1924, stands as Central Florida's premier visual arts institution, housing a permanent collection of over 2,400 works spanning from ancient Americas to contemporary art. Located in the Loch Haven Park cultural district alongside the Orlando Science Center, the museum has evolved from a small community art center into a nationally recognized institution known for its American art collection, African art holdings, and dynamic exhibition programming. As Orlando grew from a small citrus town to an international destination, OMA grew alongside it, becoming a cultural anchor for a region better known for theme parks.
