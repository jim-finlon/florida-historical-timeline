# South Florida Museum, Bishop Planetarium & Parker Manatee Aquarium
## 1946-Present

---

## Overview

The South Florida Museum in Bradenton—home to the Bishop Planetarium and the Parker Manatee Aquarium—is the largest natural and cultural history museum on Florida's Gulf Coast. Founded in 1946, the museum tells the story of Florida from prehistoric times through the Space Age while caring for Snooty, once the world's oldest manatee in captivity, and his successors. The Bishop Planetarium's digital dome and the aquarium's rescued manatees create a unique combination of astronomy, natural history, and marine conservation that has educated and inspired visitors for over seven decades.
