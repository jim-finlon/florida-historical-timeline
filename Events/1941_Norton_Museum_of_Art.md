# Norton Museum of Art: Palm Beach's Cultural Cornerstone
## 1941-Present

---

## Overview

The Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach stands as one of Florida's most distinguished art museums, housing a collection of more than 8,000 works spanning 5,000 years of world art history. Founded in 1941 by industrialist Ralph Hubbard Norton and his wife Elizabeth, the museum began with their personal collection of American art and has grown into an encyclopedic institution with particular strengths in American, European, Chinese, and contemporary art. A transformative 2019 expansion by Foster + Partners doubled the museum's gallery space and created a new architectural landmark for the Palm Beach region.
