# The World's First Commercial Airline Flight
## January 1, 1914: St. Petersburg to Tampa

---

## Overview

On New Year's Day 1914, a small wooden flying boat lifted off from the waters of Tampa Bay, carrying one passenger from St. Petersburg to Tampa. That 23-minute flight across the bay was the world's first scheduled commercial airline flight, and it launched the age of airline travel. The pilot was Tony Jannus, an experienced aviator; the passenger was Abram Pheil, the former mayor of St. Petersburg who had won the seat at auction. The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line operated for only four months, but it proved that passenger aviation was possible, practical, and profitable—and it all started in Florida.
