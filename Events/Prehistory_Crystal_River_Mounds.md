# Crystal River Archaeological State Park: Florida's Ancient Ceremonial Center
## 500 BCE - 1400 CE

---

## Overview

Crystal River Archaeological State Park preserves one of the longest continuously occupied sites in Florida—a pre-Columbian ceremonial complex used for nearly 2,000 years. Located where Crystal River meets the Gulf of Mexico, this 61-acre site contains burial mounds, temple mounds, a plaza, and two stone monuments (stelae) that are among the earliest examples of stone carving in North America. The site served as a major ceremonial center and trading hub, with artifacts from as far away as Ohio and the Great Lakes demonstrating the extensive trade networks of Florida's ancient peoples. Today, visitors can climb the temple mound and contemplate a Florida that existed millennia before European contact.
