# 1968: Both Conventions Come to Miami Beach
## A Tumultuous Year in American Politics

---

## Overview

In the explosive summer of 1968, Miami Beach hosted both the Republican and Democratic national conventions—the only time in modern American history that one city held both. While Richard Nixon secured the Republican nomination in relative calm in August, the specter of the violent Democratic convention in Chicago later that month—and the tensions surrounding the Miami gatherings—captured the era's turmoil. Outside the convention halls, Black residents of Liberty City rioted, protesters clashed with police, and the nation watched a political system under siege. The conventions brought international attention and millions of dollars to Miami Beach, but also exposed the deep fractures in American society. Nixon's nomination in Miami Beach began the journey that would lead him to the White House—and ultimately to Watergate.
