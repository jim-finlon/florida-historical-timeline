# Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge: Where Rockets and Wildlife Coexist
## 1963-Present

---

## Overview

Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge is one of America's most remarkable conservation paradoxes—140,000 acres of protected wetlands, forests, and lagoons surrounding the Kennedy Space Center, where endangered species thrive in the shadow of launch pads. Established in 1963 to serve as a buffer zone for NASA's space operations, the refuge has become one of the most biologically diverse areas in North America, home to more federally threatened and endangered species than any other refuge in the continental United States. Here, bald eagles nest within sight of spacecraft, manatees swim through the Indian River Lagoon, and Florida scrub-jays hop through the same palmetto scrub that astronauts drive past on their way to the launch pad.
