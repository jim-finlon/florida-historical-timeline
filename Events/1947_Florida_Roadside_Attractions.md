# Florida's Roadside Attractions: The Golden Age of Weird Florida
## 1930s-1970s

---

## Overview

Before Walt Disney World, Florida's tourism was defined by a gloriously eccentric collection of roadside attractions that lined the state's highways. Weeki Wachee mermaids, Gatorland alligators, Cypress Gardens water skiers, glass-bottom boats, shell factories, and hundreds of other oddities beckoned travelers with hand-painted billboards promising wonders just ahead. This was "Old Florida"—entrepreneurial, quirky, and unpolished—where families on vacation could watch alligator wrestling, peer into "bottomless" springs, see parrots ride bicycles, and buy orange wine and coconut heads. Many of these attractions survive today, beloved relics of an era when Florida tourism meant two-lane highways and homegrown spectacle.
