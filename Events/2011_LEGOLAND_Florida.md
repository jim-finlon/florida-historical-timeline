# LEGOLAND Florida: Building Dreams in Brick
## 2011-Present

---

## Overview

LEGOLAND Florida Resort, opened in 2011 on the site of the former Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, brought the iconic LEGO brand to life for families with children ages 2-12. The 150-acre theme park features over 50 rides, shows, and attractions, all themed around the colorful building blocks beloved by generations. Built on land that hosted Florida's first theme park, LEGOLAND Florida honored the historic Cypress Gardens botanical gardens while creating a new family destination that has expanded to include a water park, hotels, and the Peppa Pig Theme Park—the first of its kind in America.
