# The Florida Highwaymen: Art from the Trunk of a Car
## 1959-1980s

---

## Overview

In the late 1950s, a group of young African American artists from Fort Pierce began painting Florida's landscapes—palm trees, marshes, sunsets, and shores—using house paint on inexpensive Masonite boards. Shut out of galleries by Jim Crow segregation, they loaded their paintings into car trunks and sold them door-to-door along Florida's highways, earning a living through sheer hustle and prolific output. Known today as the Florida Highwaymen, these approximately 26 original artists produced an estimated 200,000 paintings, creating a folk art movement that preserved Florida's vanishing natural beauty while providing economic independence during the civil rights era. Once dismissed as "motel art," their work now sells for thousands of dollars and hangs in museums.
