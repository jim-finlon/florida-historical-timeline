# John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park: America's First Underwater Park
## 1960-Present

---

## Overview

John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, established in 1960, was the first underwater park in the United States, protecting 70 nautical square miles of coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove swamps off Key Largo. Named for a Miami Herald editor who championed its creation, the park preserves a portion of the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States. Visitors can snorkel among brain corals and sea fans, dive to the famous Christ of the Abyss statue, or view the underwater world through glass-bottom boats. The park pioneered the concept that marine ecosystems deserve the same protection as terrestrial wilderness.
