# Virginia Key Beach: Miami's "Colored Only" Beach
## 1945-1982

---

## Overview

For nearly four decades, Virginia Key Beach was the only beach in greater Miami where Black residents were legally allowed to swim in the ocean. Established in 1945 after years of protest and negotiation, the beach on a barrier island across the Rickenbacker Causeway became a beloved gathering place for Miami's Black community during the Jim Crow era. Families would pack picnics, ride the carousel, dance at the pavilion, and find a rare space of freedom and joy in a segregated world. After integration and decades of neglect, the beach was restored and reopened in 2008 as a historic site, preserving the memory of a community's resilience and the painful history of segregation that made such a place necessary.
