# Ringling Brothers and the Circus Capital of the World
## Sarasota and Gibsonton: Florida's Circus Heritage

---

## Overview

In 1927, John Ringling—one of the famous Ringling Brothers who built the "Greatest Show on Earth"—moved the winter headquarters of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus to Sarasota, Florida. This decision transformed the small Gulf Coast town into the "Circus Capital of the World," a title it held for decades. But Sarasota was only half the story. Fifty miles north, the tiny town of Gibsonton became the winter home for circus and carnival performers themselves—sideshow acts, "freaks," and carny workers who found acceptance in a community built by and for show people. Together, these Florida towns created a unique American subculture that thrived for most of the 20th century.
