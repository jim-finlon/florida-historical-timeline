# Florida State Seminoles: The Rise of a Dynasty
## 1947-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida State Seminoles, representing Florida State University in Tallahassee, have risen from a small women's college that only became coeducational in 1947 to one of college athletics' most feared programs. Under legendary coach Bobby Bowden, Florida State football achieved an unprecedented run of 14 consecutive top-5 finishes and won national championships in 1993, 1999, and 2013. With Chief Osceola and Renegade charging onto the field, the tomahawk chop echoing through Doak Campbell Stadium, and a tradition of excellence across all sports, the Seminoles have become synonymous with Florida athletic pride.
