## 1982-Present

---

## Overview

The Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Museum in Key West preserves and displays the remarkable treasures recovered from 17th-century Spanish shipwrecks, including the legendary Nuestra Señora de Atocha and the Santa Margarita. Founded by legendary treasure hunter Mel Fisher following his historic 1985 discovery, the museum houses gold bars, silver coins, emeralds, and rare artifacts from the 1622 fleet that sank in a hurricane off the Florida Keys. Beyond showcasing treasure, the museum educates visitors about maritime archaeology, conservation, and the dangerous world of the Spanish treasure fleets that once sailed Florida's waters.
