# The Great Depression in Florida: Boom to Bust
## 1929-1941

---

## Overview

The Great Depression hit Florida with particular severity because the state had already begun its economic collapse three years earlier with the 1926 land boom bust and devastating hurricanes. While the rest of America prospered through the Roaring Twenties, Florida was already reeling from financial disaster when the 1929 stock market crash deepened the crisis. The Depression years saw bank failures, agricultural collapse, massive unemployment, and widespread poverty, but also brought New Deal programs that built enduring infrastructure and fundamentally transformed the state's landscape and economy.
