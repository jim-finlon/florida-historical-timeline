# The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida
## 1962-Present

---

## Overview

In 1962, a group of Everglades Indians who had refused to join the Seminole Tribe of Florida gained their own federal recognition as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. These were descendants of the Seminoles who had never surrendered after the Third Seminole War, the most traditional faction who had maintained their isolation in the Everglades and resisted assimilation. The Miccosukee speak a different language than most Florida Seminoles and fought for decades to maintain their distinct identity. Today, the tribe operates from a small reservation along the Tamiami Trail, where their sovereignty, casinos, and cultural tourism provide economic independence while they work to preserve their traditional ways.
