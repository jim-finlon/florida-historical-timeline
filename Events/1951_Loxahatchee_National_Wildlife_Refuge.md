# Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge: The Northern Everglades
## 1951-Present

---

## Overview

The Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing 145,000 acres of northern Everglades wetlands in Palm Beach County, is the only remaining portion of the northern Everglades ecosystem and the largest remaining piece of this unique landscape. Established in 1951 and later named for conservationist Arthur R. Marshall, the refuge protects a mosaic of wet prairies, sloughs, tree islands, and sawgrass marshes that once extended from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Home to the endangered Everglade snail kite, wood storks, and the American alligator, the refuge serves as both a wildlife sanctuary and a critical component of South Florida's water management system.
