# Fort Mose: America's First Free Black Settlement
## 1738-1763

---

## Overview

Two miles north of St. Augustine, in 1738, the Spanish established Fort Mose (Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose)—the first legally sanctioned free Black settlement in what would become the United States. Here, escaped slaves from British Carolina found freedom under Spanish law, formed a militia, and built a community that challenged the very foundations of British slavery. Fort Mose was both a humanitarian sanctuary and a strategic weapon: Spain used the promise of freedom to destabilize British colonies while the formerly enslaved people who lived there fought fiercely to defend their liberty. Though destroyed and rebuilt, ultimately abandoned when Florida passed to Britain in 1763, Fort Mose stands as powerful proof that African Americans seized their own freedom long before the Civil War.
