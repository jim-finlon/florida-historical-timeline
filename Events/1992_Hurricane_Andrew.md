# Hurricane Andrew
## August 24, 1992

---

## Overview

On August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew—a compact, devastating Category 5 storm—made landfall in southern Miami-Dade County, becoming the most destructive natural disaster in American history up to that time. With sustained winds of 165 mph and gusts exceeding 175 mph, Andrew demolished entire communities, destroyed over 25,000 homes, damaged 100,000 more, and left 65 people dead and 250,000 homeless. The $27 billion in damage (1992 dollars) bankrupted insurance companies, reshaped building codes, and transformed emergency management. Andrew's concentrated fury reminded Americans that Florida remained vulnerable to nature's most powerful storms.
