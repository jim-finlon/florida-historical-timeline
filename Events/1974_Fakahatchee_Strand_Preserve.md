# Fakahatchee Strand Preserve: The Amazon of North America
## 1974-Present

---

## Overview

Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, spanning 85,000 acres of swamp, slough, and prairie in Collier County, is the largest state park in Florida and one of the most biologically extraordinary places in North America. Often called the "Amazon of North America," the Fakahatchee protects the largest stand of native royal palms and the greatest concentration of native orchid species in the continental United States—including the legendary ghost orchid that inspired Susan Orlean's book "The Orchid Thief." The preserve harbors Florida panthers, black bears, and perhaps the last wild crocodile-alligator overlap zone in the United States. For those willing to wade through its dark waters, the Fakahatchee reveals a primordial Florida that exists nowhere else.
