# The Founding of Miami
## July 28, 1896

---

## Overview

On July 28, 1896, the City of Miami was officially incorporated with a population of just 300 residents. The city's creation was almost entirely the work of one man: Henry M. Flagler, the Standard Oil co-founder who had been building his Florida East Coast Railway down the Atlantic coast. When Flagler extended his railroad to the shores of Biscayne Bay and built a grand hotel there, he transformed a remote trading post into a city that would become one of America's great metropolises. Miami's founding marks the birth of South Florida as we know it today.

## The Setting

### The Wilderness of South Florida

In 1895, the area that would become Miami was:

**Landscape:**
- Subtropical wilderness
- Mangroves, hardwood hammocks, wetlands
- Biscayne Bay: largest and most accessible harbor on Florida's east coast
- Mosquito-infested and humid

**Population:**
- Scattered homesteaders
- Seminole Indians
- A few trading posts and farms
- Perhaps 50-100 permanent non-native residents

**Access:**
- No roads
- No railroad
- Only by boat or extremely difficult overland trail
- Isolated from civilization

### Flagler's Railroad

By 1894, Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway had reached:

**Progress:**
- St. Augustine (1885)
- Daytona (1889)
- Palm Beach (1894)
- Each stop marked by hotel construction and development

**The Question:**
- Would Flagler continue south?
- Biscayne Bay was appealing but very remote
- Significant additional investment required

## Julia Tuttle's Persuasion

### The Woman Who Built Miami

Julia Tuttle (1849-1898) was a Cleveland widow who had moved to the Biscayne Bay area:

**Her Vision:**
- Saw the bay's potential as a great port and city
- Owned significant land on the north bank of the Miami River
- Needed the railroad to make her vision reality

**Her Challenge:**
- Convince Flagler to extend the railroad 70 miles further south
- Flagler had already invested enormously
- Why go further into the wilderness?

### The Great Freeze

In the winter of 1894-1895, a devastating freeze changed everything:

**The Freeze:**
- Killed citrus trees throughout most of Florida
- Destroyed the crops that Flagler's railroad had been built to transport
- Agricultural disaster from Jacksonville to Palm Beach

**Tuttle's Opportunity:**
- South Florida was untouched by the freeze
- She allegedly sent Flagler fresh orange blossoms from her grove
- Demonstrated that South Florida's climate was different
- The story may be apocryphal, but the invitation was real

### The Deal

Tuttle offered Flagler land in exchange for the railroad:

**The Terms:**
- Tuttle and the Brickell family (landowners on the south bank) donated land
- Flagler would receive alternating lots
- Enough land for a hotel, railroad station, and development
- Both parties would profit from the resulting growth

Flagler agreed. The railroad would come to Biscayne Bay.

## Building Miami

### The Railroad Arrives

**April 15, 1896:**
- First train arrived at Biscayne Bay
- End of track near the mouth of the Miami River
- Flagler's dream extended to the edge of the Everglades

**The Station:**
- Built near the bay
- Simple wooden structure initially
- Terminus of the line (until Key West extension, 1912)

### Flagler's Investments

Flagler immediately began developing the area:

**Infrastructure:**
- Dredged the bay and Miami River
- Built streets
- Installed water system
- Provided electrical power
- Built first sewage system

**The Royal Palm Hotel:**
- Flagler's signature Miami property
- Opened January 1897
- Elegant resort on the bay
- Attracted wealthy winter visitors

**Commerce:**
- Funded first newspaper (*The Metropolis*)
- Encouraged business development
- Provided capital for essential services

### Incorporation

**July 28, 1896:**
- City of Miami officially incorporated
- Population: approximately 300 (some sources say 343)
- Named at Flagler's suggestion (from Muskogee word "Mayaimi")
- Citizens had wanted to name it "Flagler"—he refused

**First Government:**
- First mayor: John B. Reilly (Flagler's business agent)
- City council established
- Basic municipal services organized

---

## The Story

### The Vote for Incorporation

The incorporation vote was unusual:

**The Voters:**
- All registered voters were white men (per the law)
- But approximately 160 of the 368 registered voters were Black laborers
- Many were Bahamian workers Flagler had brought to build the railroad

**The Result:**
- Vote passed overwhelmingly
- Black voters provided crucial support
- One of the few times in the Jim Crow South that Black votes were decisive

### Naming the City

Flagler declined the honor of having the city named after him:

**The Exchange:**
According to tradition, when citizens wanted to call it "Flagler," he responded:
> "I should refuse to have it named for me. Instead, use the native American name for the river running through the settlement."

The Muskogee/Creek word "Mayaimi" (or similar) referred to Lake Okeechobee and the tribes who lived there. It became "Miami."

## Significance

### Birth of South Florida

Miami's founding marked the beginning of South Florida as a developed region:

**Before 1896:**
- Virtually uninhabited (by non-natives)
- Inaccessible
- Unknown to most Americans

**After 1896:**
- Connected by railroad
- Rapidly developing
- Attracting national attention

### Flagler's Legacy

Miami was Flagler's final major Florida project (until Key West):

**His System:**
- Railroad: Florida East Coast Railway
- Hotels: Ponce de León (St. Augustine), Royal Poinciana (Palm Beach), Royal Palm (Miami)
- Cities: Essentially created Palm Beach and Miami

**His Impact:**
- Opened the entire east coast of Florida
- Set pattern of tourism-based development
- Made Florida accessible to the nation

### Rapid Growth

Miami grew faster than almost any American city:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1896 | ~300 |
| 1900 | 1,681 |
| 1910 | 5,471 |
| 1920 | 29,571 |
| 1930 | 110,637 |

## Legacy

### The City Today

From 300 people to a global metropolis:

**Greater Miami:**

- Location and climate provided potential
- But human agency made it happen
