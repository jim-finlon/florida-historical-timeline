# The Venetian Pool: Coral Gables' Aquatic Jewel
## 1924-Present

---

## Overview

Hidden in the residential streets of Coral Gables lies one of America's most beautiful public swimming pools—a Venetian-inspired lagoon carved from a coral rock quarry, complete with waterfalls, cave grottos, and Mediterranean loggias. The Venetian Pool, created in 1924 as part of George Merrick's planned city of Coral Gables, transforms what was once an ugly industrial pit into an aquatic fantasy. Fed by 820,000 gallons of spring water that is drained and refilled daily, the pool has attracted swimmers including Esther Williams and Johnny Weissmuller, and remains one of the few pools in the nation listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It stands as proof of Merrick's vision that even utilitarian structures could be works of art.
