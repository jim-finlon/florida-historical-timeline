# Tennessee Williams in Key West: The Playwright's Paradise
## 1941-1983

---

## Overview

Tennessee Williams first arrived in Key West in 1941, a struggling young playwright seeking warmth and inspiration. He found both, and for the next four decades, Key West became his primary home, his creative sanctuary, and the setting for some of his most important work. Williams wrote parts of "A Streetcar Named Desire" in Key West, completed "The Night of the Iguana" there, and made the island's bohemian atmosphere his own. His presence helped establish Key West's identity as an artists' haven and gay-friendly destination. Today, his modest house on Duncan Street is preserved as a guesthouse, and his ghost is said to walk the streets he loved.
