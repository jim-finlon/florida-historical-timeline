# Harry P. Leu Gardens: Orlando's Botanical Treasure
## 1936-Present

---

## Overview

Harry P. Leu Gardens, a 50-acre botanical oasis in the heart of Orlando, preserves one of Central Florida's finest collections of camellias, roses, and subtropical plants on the shores of Lake Rowena. The gardens surround the historic Leu House Museum, a 19th-century farmhouse expanded by industrialist Harry P. Leu and his wife Mary Jane after they purchased the property in 1936. When the Leus donated their estate to the City of Orlando in 1961, they created a lasting gift that combines horticultural excellence with historic preservation, offering a peaceful retreat from the tourist attractions that would come to define the region.
