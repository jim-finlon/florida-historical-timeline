# Jean Ribault and the Founding of Charlesfort
## 1562

---

## Overview

In May 1562, French explorer Jean Ribault sailed into the mouth of a great river on the coast of La Florida, which he named the River of May (today's St. Johns River). Leading an expedition of French Huguenots (Protestants) seeking refuge from religious persecution, Ribault explored the coast northward, ultimately establishing Charlesfort on present-day Parris Island, South Carolina—the first French settlement in the territory Spain claimed as its own. Though Charlesfort lasted barely a year before being abandoned, Ribault's expedition opened a decade of French-Spanish conflict over Florida and set the stage for the founding of Fort Caroline and St. Augustine.

## The Setting

### The French Wars of Religion

France in the 1560s was tearing itself apart:

**Religious Divide:**
- Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots) engaged in increasingly violent conflict
- Massacres, assassinations, and civil war destabilized the kingdom
- Neither side could eliminate the other

**Huguenot Vulnerability:**
- Protestants were a minority (perhaps 10% of the population)
- Subject to periodic persecutions
- Powerful nobles protected them, but the situation remained precarious

**Dreams of Escape:**
- Some Huguenot leaders envisioned New World colonies as refuges
- A Protestant France in America, free from Catholic persecution
- Distance from Europe's religious wars

### Gaspard de Coligny's Vision

Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the most powerful Huguenot noble, championed American colonization:

- **Military leader:** Supreme commander of Huguenot forces
- **Strategist:** Saw colonial ventures as serving both religious and political goals
- **Patron:** Organized and financed the Florida expeditions
- **Vision:** A Huguenot haven in the New World that could also challenge Spanish hegemony

### Why Florida?

Florida attracted French interest for several reasons:

1. **Climate:** Thought to be suitable for European settlement
2. **Location:** Strategic position threatening Spanish treasure fleets
3. **Spain's failure:** Multiple Spanish disasters suggested the region might be conquered
4. **Religious freedom:** Distance from European powers meant freedom to worship

## The Story

### Discovery of the River of May

On May 1, 1562, the feast of the Ascension, Ribault's ships entered the mouth of a broad river on Florida's Atlantic coast. The date—a major Christian holy day—struck Ribault as providential. He named the waterway the River of May (Rivière de Mai) and anchored to explore.

The scene that greeted them seemed like paradise. The spring flowers were in bloom. The forests teemed with wildlife. The river was full of fish. Most importantly, the native Timucua who appeared on the banks were friendly, even welcoming.

Ribault ordered a stone column erected on the south bank, bearing the arms of France. It was the first French territorial claim in what would become the United States.

### Exploring the Coast

Rather than settle immediately at the River of May, Ribault decided to explore northward, seeking the best possible location:

**May 1562:**
- Sailed north along the coast
- Named rivers after the great rivers of France (Seine, Somme, Loire, etc.)
- Marveled at the beauty of the landscape
- Noted excellent harbors and fertile land

**Interactions with Natives:**
- Generally peaceful and friendly
- The Timucua and related peoples welcomed trade
- Gift exchanges established good relations
- Ribault was impressed by native hospitality

### Founding of Charlesfort

At Port Royal Sound (present-day South Carolina), Ribault found what he sought:

**The Site:**
- A magnificent natural harbor
- Protected anchorage for ships
- Abundant fresh water
- Rich hunting and fishing grounds
- Friendly native population

**The Decision:**
Ribault decided to establish a settlement on a small island in the sound (present-day Parris Island):

- Named it Charlesfort after young King Charles IX of France
- Left approximately 28 men to hold the settlement
- Appointed Albert de la Pierria as commander
- Promised to return quickly with supplies and reinforcements

**The Departure:**
In early June 1562, Ribault sailed for France, leaving behind the first French colonists in North America.

## The Fate of Charlesfort

### The Garrison

The 28 men left at Charlesfort faced an uncertain future:

**Initial Period:**
- Built a small fortification
- Established relations with local Cusabo Indians
- Traded for food
- Waited for Ribault's return

**Problems Emerged:**
- Captain Albert de la Pierria proved tyrannical
- Executed one soldier for minor offenses
- Exiled another to an island to starve
- His brutality bred resentment

**Mutiny:**
- The garrison eventually killed Albert de la Pierria
- Elected a new leader, Nicolas Barré
- Discipline collapsed

**Desperation:**
- Months passed with no word from France
- Supplies ran low
- The natives, initially friendly, grew tired of feeding the French
- The men decided to attempt a return to France

### The Voyage Home

With remarkable (and desperate) ingenuity, the colonists built a small boat:

**Construction:**
- Used pine trees for planking
- Sealed cracks with moss and pine pitch
- Made sails from shirts and bedding
- Wove ropes from Spanish moss

**The Voyage:**
- Set sail with minimal provisions
- Became becalmed in mid-Atlantic
- Ran out of food and water
- According to accounts, resorted to cannibalism to survive

**Rescue:**
- An English ship found the survivors
- Brought them to England rather than France
- Ribault, having fled to England to escape religious persecution at home, may have met with them

### Why Ribault Didn't Return

Ribault intended to return quickly to Charlesfort but was delayed by events in France:

**Religious War:**
- Civil war between Catholics and Huguenots erupted in March 1562
- Coligny and the Huguenots were besieged
- No resources could be spared for American ventures

**Ribault's Exile:**
- The war forced Ribault to flee France
- He spent 1562-1564 in England
- Attempted to interest the English in Florida (unsuccessfully)
- Eventually imprisoned on suspicion of spying

The colonists at Charlesfort were forgotten casualties of European religious warfare.

## Significance

### First French Foothold

Charlesfort represented France's first attempt to challenge Spain in Florida:

- Established French territorial claim
- Proved settlement was possible (at least briefly)
- Gathered information for future expeditions
- Demonstrated native willingness to cooperate with non-Spanish Europeans

### Religious Dimension

The expedition's Protestant character was crucial:

- Challenged Catholic Spain's monopoly on American colonization
- Provided hope for Huguenot refugees
- Added religious hatred to imperial competition
- Foreshadowed the bloody events of 1565

### Setting the Stage

Charlesfort's failure did not end French interest in Florida:

- Ribault's glowing accounts circulated widely
- Interest remained high among Huguenots
- Coligny began planning a larger expedition
- In 1564, Laudonnière would return to build Fort Caroline

### Documentation

Ribault wrote an account of his expedition, *The True and Last Discoverie of Florida* (published in English, 1563):

- Detailed descriptions of the coast and natives
- Promotional material designed to encourage colonization
- Important early source for Florida history
- Influenced later English interest in the region

---

## The Spanish Reaction

Spain was alarmed by news of French activity in La Florida:

**Intelligence:**
- Spanish spies reported Ribault's expedition
- The French claim threatened Spain's American monopoly
- Religious dimension made it intolerable to Catholic Spain

**Delayed Response:**
- Spain was occupied with other matters initially
- The collapse of Charlesfort seemed to solve the problem temporarily
- But when the French returned in 1564, Spain would act decisively

**Long-term Consequence:**
- French presence forced Spain to finally establish permanent settlements in Florida
- St. Augustine (1565) was founded specifically to counter French threat
- The strategic importance of Florida was confirmed
