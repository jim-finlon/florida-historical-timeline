# Canaveral National Seashore: Florida's Longest Undeveloped Beach
## 1975-Present

---

## Overview

Canaveral National Seashore preserves 24 miles of pristine Atlantic coastline—the longest stretch of undeveloped beach on Florida's east coast. Established in 1975, this 57,000-acre sanctuary protects barrier island ecosystems, coastal dunes, sea turtle nesting beaches, and the historic Eldora village site. Sandwiched between the Kennedy Space Center and New Smyrna Beach, the seashore's creation saved one of Florida's last wild coastlines from the development that consumed most of the state's beaches. Today, visitors experience Florida as the first explorers saw it—endless beach, rolling dunes, and maritime hammocks untouched by condominiums and hotels.
