# Al Capone in Miami Beach
## 1928-1947

---

## Overview

In 1928, Al Capone—America's most notorious gangster, the man who controlled Chicago's underworld during Prohibition—bought a waterfront estate on Palm Island in Miami Beach. For the next two decades, the property served as his winter retreat, the site of infamous parties, and eventually the place where he died. Capone's presence in Miami symbolized the city's anything-goes atmosphere during the Roaring Twenties and its complicated relationship with wealth, regardless of its source. Though local authorities sometimes tried to expel him, Capone remained a Miami resident, entertaining celebrities and conducting business from his palm-shaded compound until his health and legal troubles caught up with him.
