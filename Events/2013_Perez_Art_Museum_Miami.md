# Pérez Art Museum Miami: Miami's Waterfront Art Destination
## 2013-Present

---

## Overview

The Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architects Herzog & de Meuron, stands as one of America's most striking museum buildings—a dramatic structure of stacked platforms shaded by a canopy of hanging gardens overlooking Biscayne Bay. Opened in 2013 in Miami's Museum Park, PAMM replaced the older Miami Art Museum with a purpose-built facility that reflects Miami's identity as a global crossroads of Latin American, Caribbean, and international contemporary art. The museum's collection and programming emphasize the art of the 20th and 21st centuries, with particular strength in works by artists from the Americas, making it a fitting cultural anchor for one of the world's most international cities.
