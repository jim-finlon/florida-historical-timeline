# The Florida Theatre: Jacksonville's Movie Palace
## 1927-Present

---

## Overview

When the Florida Theatre opened in Jacksonville on April 8, 1927, it was the most magnificent building most Floridians had ever entered—a Mediterranean Revival fantasy with gilded ornamentation, a ceiling painted to resemble a starlit sky, and an atmosphere designed to make ordinary people feel like royalty. Part of the great wave of American movie palaces, the Florida Theatre was built when going to the movies was an experience, not just an entertainment. For nearly a century, the theater has survived the decline of downtown, the collapse of movie palaces, the threat of demolition, and emerged as a beloved performing arts center, one of the finest restored theaters in the South.
