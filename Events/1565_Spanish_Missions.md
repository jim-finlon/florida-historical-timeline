# The Spanish Missions of La Florida
## 1565-1763

---

## Overview

For nearly 200 years, a chain of Spanish Catholic missions stretched across Florida and into Georgia, representing one of the most ambitious colonization efforts in North American history. Franciscan friars established over 100 missions among the indigenous peoples, converting tens of thousands to Christianity and Spanish allegiance. At their peak in the mid-1600s, the missions supported a population of 26,000 Christian Indians in thriving communities that combined Native agriculture with Spanish religious practice. But disease, English raids, and the relentless pressure of the Carolina colony destroyed the mission system entirely by 1704, leaving only archaeological traces of a forgotten empire of faith.
