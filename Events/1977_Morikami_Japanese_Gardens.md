# Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens: The Yamato Colony's Legacy
## 1905-Present

---

## Overview

The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Delray Beach preserves the remarkable legacy of the Yamato Colony—a pioneering Japanese agricultural settlement established in 1905 in the wilderness of South Florida. When George Sukeji Morikami, the colony's last surviving member, donated his land to Palm Beach County in 1977, he ensured that this unique chapter in Florida's immigration history would never be forgotten. Today, the 200-acre property features world-class Japanese gardens, a museum of Japanese arts and culture, and tells the story of the young Japanese farmers who came to America seeking opportunity and found themselves building a community in an unlikely subtropical frontier.
