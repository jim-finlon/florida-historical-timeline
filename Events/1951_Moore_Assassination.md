# Assassination of Harry T. and Harriette Moore
## December 25, 1951

---

## Overview

On Christmas night, 1951, a bomb exploded beneath the bedroom of Harry T. Moore and his wife Harriette at their home in Mims, Florida. Harry Moore, the executive director of the Florida State Conference of NAACP branches and the most prominent Black civil rights leader in Florida, died from his injuries that night. Harriette Moore died nine days later. They became the first NAACP officials murdered in the civil rights struggle and the only married couple to be killed for their activism. The bombing, almost certainly the work of the Ku Klux Klan, was never solved during the killers' lifetimes, and the case became a symbol of the violent resistance to civil rights and the failure of justice in the Jim Crow South.
