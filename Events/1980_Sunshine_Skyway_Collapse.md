# The Sunshine Skyway Bridge Disaster
## May 9, 1980

---

## Overview

On the morning of May 9, 1980, the freighter MV Summit Venture struck the Sunshine Skyway Bridge spanning Tampa Bay during a sudden, violent squall. The impact knocked out 1,400 feet of the main span, sending vehicles plummeting 150 feet into the water below. Thirty-five people died, including the occupants of cars, a pickup truck, and a Greyhound bus, making it one of the worst bridge disasters in American history. The tragedy led to the demolition of the damaged bridge and construction of a new, safer Sunshine Skyway that opened in 1987. The incident also prompted new federal standards for bridge protection from ship collisions.
