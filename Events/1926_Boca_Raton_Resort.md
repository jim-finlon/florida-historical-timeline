# The Boca Raton Resort: Addison Mizner's Last Palace
## 1926-Present

---

## Overview

The Boca Raton Resort and Club was meant to be architect Addison Mizner's masterpiece—a Mediterranean fantasy to surpass even his Palm Beach creations, the centerpiece of a new city he would build from scratch. When the Cloister Inn opened in February 1926, it was the most expensive hotel per room ever built, a pink palace of Spanish-Moorish architecture along the Intracoastal Waterway. But within months, the Florida land boom collapsed, Mizner's plans crumbled, and he lost everything. The hotel survived, evolved, and became one of America's great resorts, while Mizner died in relative obscurity—the building his lasting monument.
