# Palm Beach and West Palm Beach: The Gold Coast
## 1894-Present

---

## Overview

Palm Beach and its mainland sibling West Palm Beach represent the quintessential Florida story of transformation from wilderness to wealth. When Henry Flagler extended his Florida East Coast Railway to the shores of Lake Worth in 1894, he created what would become America's most glamorous winter resort—an island enclave where Gilded Age fortunes built Mediterranean palaces and where the nation's elite escaped Northern winters. West Palm Beach, originally created to house the workers who served Palm Beach's mansions, grew into a thriving city in its own right. Together, they anchor Palm Beach County, Florida's wealthiest and one of its most populous counties.
