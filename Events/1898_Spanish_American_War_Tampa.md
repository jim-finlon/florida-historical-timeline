# Tampa and the Spanish-American War
## 1898: Florida's Gateway to Cuba

---

## Overview

In the spring of 1898, Tampa, Florida, became the primary embarkation point for American forces invading Cuba during the Spanish-American War. For three chaotic months, this small Gulf Coast city of 26,000 was transformed into a military camp of 30,000 soldiers, including Theodore Roosevelt's famous Rough Riders. The war—which lasted only 113 days—made Tampa briefly the center of American military operations and cemented Florida's strategic importance. The legacy of 1898 includes Tampa's continued military significance, the romantic mythology of the Rough Riders, and Florida's role as a gateway to the Caribbean.
