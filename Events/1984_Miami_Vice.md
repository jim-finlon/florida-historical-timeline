## 1984-1990

---

## Overview

On September 16, 1984, NBC debuted *Miami Vice*, a police drama that would transform not just television but the city it depicted. Created by Anthony Yerkovich and produced by Michael Mann, the show followed undercover detectives Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) and Ricardo Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) through Miami's neon-lit drug underworld. With its pastel suits, designer stubble, rock-and-pop soundtrack, and stunning cinematography of Miami's Art Deco architecture, *Miami Vice* made the city the coolest place in America. The show didn't just reflect Miami—it reinvented it, sparking a renaissance of the Art Deco district, driving fashion trends, and permanently changing how Americans saw South Florida.
