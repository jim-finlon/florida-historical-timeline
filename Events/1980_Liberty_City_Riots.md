# The Liberty City Riots
## May 17-19, 1980

---

## Overview

On May 17, 1980, an all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four white Metro-Dade police officers accused of beating to death Arthur McDuffie, a Black insurance executive. Within hours, Miami's Liberty City neighborhood exploded in the worst race riot in American history since the 1960s. For three days, violence engulfed Liberty City, Overtown, and other predominantly Black neighborhoods. By the time the National Guard restored order, 18 people were dead, over 300 injured, and property damage exceeded $100 million. The Liberty City Riots exposed the deep racial tensions simmering beneath Miami's sunny surface and marked a turning point in the city's history.
