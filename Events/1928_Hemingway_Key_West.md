# Ernest Hemingway in Key West
## 1928-1940

---

## Overview

In April 1928, Ernest Hemingway—fresh from the success of *The Sun Also Rises*—arrived in Key West, Florida, to pick up a car being shipped from the factory. He intended to stay only briefly. Instead, he fell in love with the island's tropical remoteness, its fishing, its bars, and its cast of characters. For the next twelve years, Key West would be Hemingway's primary American home, the place where he wrote some of his greatest works including *A Farewell to Arms*, *To Have and Have Not*, *Green Hills of Africa*, *Death in the Afternoon*, and *For Whom the Bell Tolls*. The house he purchased on Whitehead Street, with its famous six-toed cats, remains one of Florida's most visited literary landmarks.
