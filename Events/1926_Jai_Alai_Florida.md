# Jai Alai in Florida: The Fastest Game on Earth
## 1926-Present

---

## Overview

Jai alai, the Basque sport billed as "the fastest game on earth," found its American home in Florida beginning in 1926 and became synonymous with the state's gambling culture for decades. Players hurling pelota balls at speeds exceeding 180 mph in Miami, Tampa, and frontons across the state drew millions of spectators who wagered on the action. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, Florida's jai alai frontons were glamorous destinations that generated hundreds of millions in betting handle. Though the sport has dramatically declined with competition from casinos and the lottery, jai alai remains part of Florida's unique cultural heritage.
