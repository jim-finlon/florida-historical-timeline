# Kingsley Plantation: Slavery, Freedom, and a Florida Family
## 1814-Present

---

## Overview

On Fort George Island at the mouth of the St. Johns River stands Florida's oldest surviving plantation house and one of the most complex sites in American history. Here, in the early 1800s, Zephaniah Kingsley—slave trader, plantation owner, and defender of slavery—lived with Anna Madgigine Jai, an enslaved African woman he purchased, freed, and married. Their extraordinary story challenges simple narratives of slavery, as Kingsley argued for a more "humane" form of bondage while Anna became a successful landowner in her own right. Today, the plantation's surviving slave cabins and the Kingsley house tell the intertwined stories of enslaved laborers, free people of color, and the complicated realities of antebellum Florida.
