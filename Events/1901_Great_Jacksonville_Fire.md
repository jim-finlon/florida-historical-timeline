# The Great Jacksonville Fire of 1901
## May 3, 1901: The Largest Urban Fire in Southern History

---

## Overview

On the afternoon of May 3, 1901, a small fire started at a mattress factory in downtown Jacksonville, Florida. Within eight hours, the fire had consumed 146 city blocks—nearly 2,000 buildings—and left almost 10,000 people homeless. The Great Fire of 1901 destroyed the commercial heart of Florida's largest city, causing $15 million in damage (equivalent to over $500 million today). It remains the largest urban fire in the history of the American South and one of the worst urban fires in U.S. history. Yet Jacksonville rebuilt quickly and emerged as a more modern, more prosperous city, demonstrating the resilience that would characterize Florida's growth.
