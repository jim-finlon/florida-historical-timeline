# The Calusa: Lords of Southwest Florida
## Prehistory-1700s

---

## Overview

The Calusa were the most powerful Native American nation in Florida when Europeans arrived—a maritime empire that dominated southwest Florida, built massive shell mound complexes, collected tribute from subject peoples, and held off Spanish colonization for nearly 200 years. Unlike most North American peoples, the Calusa never practiced agriculture; they built their complex society entirely on fishing, shellfish harvesting, and collecting tribute. Their capital at Mound Key in Estero Bay featured engineered canals, towering shell mounds, and a great chief's house that astonished Spanish visitors. Disease and slave raids eventually destroyed the Calusa, and by 1763, the survivors fled to Cuba, leaving only their shell mounds to testify to their greatness.
