# Daytona Beach Racing and the Birth of NASCAR
## 1903-Present

---

## Overview

The hard-packed sand of Daytona Beach, Florida, became America's premier automobile racing venue starting in 1903, when the first timed speed runs were held on the beach. For decades, the "World's Most Famous Beach" hosted land speed record attempts, attracting drivers from around the world to push the limits of automotive technology on the smooth, wide strand. In 1936, the city began hosting stock car races on a beach-road course, and in 1948, local promoter Bill France Sr. founded NASCAR in Daytona Beach. The opening of Daytona International Speedway in 1959 cemented Daytona as the capital of American stock car racing. From wealthy sportsmen chasing records to bootleggers racing modified cars, Daytona's racing heritage shaped an entire American industry.
