# Ormond Beach: The Millionaires' Colony
## 1888-1937

---

## Overview

In the late 19th century, Ormond Beach became winter home to America's wealthiest families—the Rockefellers, the Astors, the Vanderbilts. John D. Rockefeller Sr., the world's richest man, spent his final two decades wintering at The Casements, his rambling oceanfront estate, where locals would see him handing out dimes to children and playing golf on his private course. The beach itself gained fame as the birthplace of speed, where hard-packed sand allowed early automobiles to set world land speed records. Today, The Casements serves as Ormond Beach's cultural center, and the city proudly remembers its Gilded Age heritage as the place where America's elite discovered Florida.
