# Pelican Island: America's First National Wildlife Refuge
## 1903-Present

---

## Overview

On March 14, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an executive order creating the first national wildlife refuge in American history: Pelican Island, a five-acre mangrove island in Florida's Indian River Lagoon. The tiny island was home to the only remaining brown pelican rookery on Florida's east coast—birds that plume hunters had nearly exterminated. Roosevelt's simple question—"Is there any law that will prevent me from declaring Pelican Island a Federal Bird Reservation?"—launched the National Wildlife Refuge System that now encompasses over 560 refuges and 150 million acres. Florida's Pelican Island remains the symbolic birthplace of America's commitment to wildlife protection.
