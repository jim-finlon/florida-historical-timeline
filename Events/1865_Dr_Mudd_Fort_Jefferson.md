# Dr. Samuel Mudd: The Prisoner of Fort Jefferson
## 1865-1869

---

## Overview

When Dr. Samuel Mudd set the broken leg of a stranger who knocked on his door in the early morning hours of April 15, 1865, he sealed his fate as one of history's most controversial figures. The stranger was John Wilkes Booth, fleeing after assassinating President Abraham Lincoln. Mudd was convicted of conspiracy in the assassination, sentenced to life imprisonment, and sent to Fort Jefferson—a massive brick fortress on a remote island in the Dry Tortugas, 70 miles west of Key West. There, in conditions of brutal isolation, Mudd served nearly four years before a presidential pardon freed him. Was he a conspirator or a victim of circumstance? The debate continues, but his imprisonment at Fort Jefferson remains one of the strangest chapters in both Civil War and Florida history.
