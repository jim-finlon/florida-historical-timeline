# Zora Neale Hurston and Eatonville
## America's First Incorporated Black Town and Its Famous Daughter

---

## Overview

In 1887, Eatonville, Florida, became one of the first incorporated African American municipalities in the United States—a town founded, governed, and populated entirely by Black citizens during the harshest years of Jim Crow. This small community near Orlando became the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston (1891-1960), who would become one of the most important writers of the 20th century. Hurston drew deeply on Eatonville's culture, language, and stories in her novels, most famously *Their Eyes Were Watching God*, preserving and celebrating a Black Southern community where African Americans lived free from white supervision. Eatonville and Hurston together represent a remarkable chapter in Florida and American history.
