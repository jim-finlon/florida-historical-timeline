# Blowing Rocks Preserve: The Limestone Coast
## 1969-Present

---

## Overview

Blowing Rocks Preserve on Jupiter Island protects the largest outcrop of Anastasia limestone on the Atlantic coast—a dramatic formation where, during high surf, waves crash through solution holes in the rock and spray plumes of seawater up to 50 feet into the air. This spectacular natural phenomenon gives the preserve its name and draws visitors to one of Florida's most unusual coastal landscapes. The 73-acre preserve, managed by The Nature Conservancy since 1969, also protects one of the last undeveloped stretches of barrier island in South Florida, providing critical nesting habitat for sea turtles and shorebirds.
