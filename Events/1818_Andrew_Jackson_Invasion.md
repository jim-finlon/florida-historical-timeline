# Andrew Jackson's Invasion of Florida
## 1818

---

## Overview

In 1818, General Andrew Jackson led an unauthorized military invasion of Spanish Florida that would change the course of American history. Ostensibly pursuing Seminole Indians who had been raiding Georgia settlements, Jackson exceeded his orders, invaded a foreign nation, captured Spanish forts at St. Marks and Pensacola, and executed two British subjects—actions that nearly caused wars with both Spain and Britain. The invasion demonstrated that Spain could not defend Florida and accelerated negotiations that led to Spain ceding the territory to the United States in 1819. Jackson's aggressive, controversial campaign made him a national hero to many Americans and launched the political career that would eventually make him president.
