## Overview

Miami Seaquarium, opened in 1955 on Virginia Key, is one of America's oldest oceanariums and a landmark of South Florida entertainment history. Famous as the filming location for the television series "Flipper" in the 1960s, the 38-acre marine park has introduced millions of visitors to dolphins, killer whales, manatees, and other marine life over nearly seven decades. While evolving with changing attitudes about captive marine mammals, the Seaquarium continues its mission of marine education and conservation while remaining an iconic Miami destination.
