# Gasparilla: Tampa's Pirate Invasion
## 1904-Present

---

## Overview

Every winter, a fully rigged pirate ship sails into Tampa Bay while its costumed crew fires cannons at the city and the mayor hands over the keys in mock surrender. This is Gasparilla, Tampa's signature festival and one of America's most unique civic celebrations, a rowdy tribute to a pirate who almost certainly never existed. José Gaspar—"Gasparilla"—was supposedly a Spanish naval officer turned pirate who terrorized the Gulf Coast in the early 1800s, but historians have found no evidence he ever lived. No matter: since 1904, Tampa has embraced the legend, creating a festival that has grown from an elite social club event into a citywide celebration that draws hundreds of thousands and rivals New Orleans' Mardi Gras in exuberance.
