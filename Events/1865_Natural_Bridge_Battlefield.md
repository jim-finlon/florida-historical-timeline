# The Battle of Natural Bridge: Tallahassee's Salvation
## March 6, 1865

---

## Overview

The Battle of Natural Bridge, fought on March 6, 1865, was the last significant Confederate victory of the Civil War and saved Tallahassee from Union occupation—making it the only Confederate state capital east of the Mississippi never captured by Union forces. The battle took place at a geological oddity where the St. Marks River disappears underground before reemerging half a mile downstream, creating a natural land bridge that became a defensive chokepoint. A hastily assembled force of Confederate troops, militia, and cadets from the West Florida Seminary (now Florida State University) repulsed a Union force attempting to march on Tallahassee. Today, Natural Bridge Battlefield Historic State Park commemorates this little-known but significant engagement.
