# Julia Tuttle: The Mother of Miami
## 1848-1898

---

## Overview

Julia DeForest Sturtevant Tuttle was the only woman to found a major American city. In the early 1890s, this Cleveland widow moved to the wilderness at the mouth of the Miami River and became obsessed with building a city there. She lobbied, cajoled, and ultimately convinced railroad magnate Henry Flagler to extend his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami, offering him half her land in exchange. When the Great Freeze of 1894-95 devastated North Florida's citrus, Tuttle famously sent Flagler fresh orange blossoms to prove her land remained untouched by frost. Flagler came, the railroad followed, and Miami was born. Tuttle died just two years after the city's founding, but her vision created Florida's largest metropolis.
