# The Founding of Fort Caroline
## June 22, 1564

---

## Overview

On June 22, 1564, French explorer René Goulaine de Laudonnière led approximately 200 Huguenot colonists ashore at the mouth of the St. Johns River in northeastern Florida, where they began construction of Fort Caroline—the first sustained European settlement in what would become the United States. For over a year, this French Protestant outpost clung to existence on the edge of the wilderness, its colonists struggling with hunger, mutiny, and conflict with native peoples. Fort Caroline's presence would trigger a violent Spanish response that would end in massacre—but for fourteen months, France held a piece of La Florida.

## The Setting

### After Charlesfort

Two years had passed since Jean Ribault's 1562 expedition:

**Charlesfort's Failure:**
- The colony had been abandoned in 1563
- Survivors' tales of hardship circulated
- But so did Ribault's glowing descriptions of Florida

**Ribault's Detention:**
- Still held in England, unable to lead a new expedition
- Would not return to France until 1565

**Coligny's Persistence:**
- Admiral de Coligny refused to abandon his vision
- The French Wars of Religion were in temporary truce
- Opportunity existed for a renewed attempt

### The New Plan

Coligny organized a larger, better-supplied expedition:

- **Stronger force:** More colonists, more supplies
- **Different leader:** Laudonnière, Ribault's former second-in-command
- **Clearer goals:** Establish permanent settlement, not just exploratory outpost
- **Same location:** Return to the promising River of May

## The Story

### Return to the River of May

When Laudonnière's ships entered the St. Johns River on June 22, 1564, he was returning to a place he had seen briefly two years before. The stone column Ribault had erected was still standing, now venerated by the local Timucua as a sacred object. The natives greeted the French with enthusiasm, offering food and friendship.

Laudonnière selected a site for the settlement: a bluff on the river's south bank, about five miles from its mouth. Here, where a small stream provided fresh water and the terrain offered natural defenses, the colonists would build their new home.

### Construction of Fort Caroline

The colonists immediately began construction:

**The Fort:**
- Triangular earthwork fortification
- Walls of earth and timber
- Moat on the landward sides
- River access for supply and escape
- Named for King Charles IX of France (Caroline = Charles)

**Supporting Structures:**
- Barracks for soldiers
- Storage buildings for supplies
- Workshops for craftsmen
- Chapel for Protestant worship

**The Work:**
- Completed in approximately two months
- Involved all colonists
- Timucua sometimes assisted

### Relations with the Timucua

The French found allies among the local Timucua:

**Chief Saturiwa:**
- Paramount chief of the Timucua near Fort Caroline
- Initially welcomed the French as trading partners and potential military allies
- Saw French weapons as useful against his enemies
- Provided corn, game, and fish to the hungry colonists

**The Alliance:**
- French traded metal tools, beads, and cloth for food
- Timucua expected French military support against rival chief Utina
- Laudonnière tried to balance between warring native factions
- Tensions developed when French couldn't or wouldn't fulfill expectations

### The Crisis of Supply

Despite Timucua assistance, Fort Caroline faced chronic food shortages:

**Problems:**
- Colonists were not farmers; few had agricultural experience
- Florida's climate proved challenging for European crops
- Too few colonists for both construction and food production
- Native food supplies were limited, especially after droughts

**Consequences:**
- Rationing implemented
- Colonists grew weak and demoralized
- Tensions between soldiers and artisans
- Discipline began to break down

### Mutiny and Piracy

By late 1564, desperation bred rebellion:

**First Mutiny (November 1564):**
- Thirteen soldiers conspired to seize a boat
- Planned to sail to the Caribbean to raid Spanish ships
- Plot discovered; leaders executed

**Second Mutiny (December 1564):**
- More successful; approximately 66 colonists seized two barques
- Sailed to the Caribbean
- Attacked Spanish ships and settlements
- Some killed; others captured by Spanish
- Survivors eventually returned to Fort Caroline, bringing Spanish prisoners

**Consequences:**
- Spanish now had direct intelligence about Fort Caroline
- News of French Protestant pirates in La Florida alarmed the Spanish Crown
- Laudonnière's authority was undermined
- The colony was more divided than ever

### Le Moyne's Artwork

One of Fort Caroline's lasting contributions came from Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, the expedition's artist:

**His Work:**
- Painted watercolors of Timucua life
- Depicted villages, ceremonies, agriculture, warfare
- Showed native dress, body decoration, and customs
- Created the most detailed visual record of pre-contact Florida Indians

**Significance:**
- Original paintings lost, but published as engravings (1591)
- Only visual documentation of 16th-century Florida Timucua
- Invaluable to historians and anthropologists
- Still used to understand Timucua culture

### 1565: The Beginning of the End

By summer 1565, Fort Caroline was on the verge of collapse:

**Desperate Measures:**
- Laudonnière considered abandoning the colony
- Colonists built boats for potential evacuation
- Food supplies nearly exhausted
- Morale at lowest point

**English Rescue:**
- In August 1565, English privateer John Hawkins arrived
- Sold the colonists a ship and provisions
- Colonists prepared to abandon Fort Caroline

**Ribault's Arrival:**
- Just as departure was imminent, Jean Ribault arrived (August 28, 1565)
- Brought reinforcements: 600 soldiers, colonists, and supplies
- Brought orders to relieve Laudonnière of command
- Hope was restored—briefly

**But danger was closer than they knew.** Just days before Ribault's arrival, a Spanish fleet under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés had sailed from Spain with orders to destroy the French colony and establish Spanish control of La Florida.

## Significance

### First Sustained European Settlement

Fort Caroline holds a significant place in American history:

- **Duration:** Fourteen months (longer than Charlesfort, Luna's colony, etc.)
- **Community:** Included women, religious services, organized government
- **Documentation:** Le Moyne's art and multiple written accounts
- **Influence:** Forced Spain to establish St. Augustine

### Religious Dimension

The Protestant character of Fort Caroline shaped its fate:

- Represented Huguenot hopes for refuge
- Provoked Catholic Spain to violent response
- Made the colony a target in European religious wars
- Its destruction became a Huguenot martyrdom

### Documentation of Timucua Culture

Thanks to Laudonnière's writing and Le Moyne's art, Fort Caroline provides the best record of:

- Timucua daily life and customs
- Political organization and warfare
- Religious practices and ceremonies
- Interaction with Europeans before massive population decline

### Setting the Stage for Tragedy

Fort Caroline's existence made the events of September 1565 inevitable:

- Spain could not tolerate a French presence in La Florida
- Protestant "heretics" added religious motivation to strategic concerns
- The colony's weakness invited attack
- The result would be massacre and the founding of St. Augustine

---

## The End Approaches

As this account concludes, Fort Caroline stood at its most hopeful moment. Ribault had arrived with reinforcements. The colonists, so recently preparing to abandon their settlement, now looked forward to expansion and prosperity.

But 40 miles to the south, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés was establishing a Spanish base at St. Augustine. Within weeks, Fort Caroline would be attacked, its garrison slaughtered, and its brief existence erased by Spanish swords.

The story continues in the accounts of the Fall of Fort Caroline and the Massacre at Matanzas Inlet.
