## Overview

The Appleton Museum of Art in Ocala, opened in 1987, brings world-class art to Florida's horse country through a stunning marble-clad facility housing over 24,000 works spanning 5,000 years of human creativity. Founded by industrialist Arthur I. Appleton as a gift to the Ocala community, the museum—now part of the College of Central Florida—features significant collections of European, American, Asian, African, and Pre-Columbian art. Set amid Marion County's rolling pastures and thoroughbred farms, the Appleton demonstrates that exceptional art collections can thrive far from major metropolitan centers.
