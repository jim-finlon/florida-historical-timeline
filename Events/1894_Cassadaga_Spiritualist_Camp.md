# Cassadaga: The Psychic Capital of the World
## 1894-Present

---

## Overview

In 1894, George P. Colby, a spiritualist medium from New York, founded a community of like-minded believers in the Florida scrub near DeLand, following what he said was the guidance of his Native American spirit guide named "Seneca." The community he established, Cassadaga, has survived for over 130 years as America's oldest active spiritualist community. Today, this tiny village of Victorian cottages and weathered hotels remains home to certified mediums and healers who offer readings, séances, and spiritual guidance to the thousands of visitors who arrive each year seeking contact with the dead, insight into the future, or simply a glimpse of the unusual. Cassadaga is a living museum of American spiritualism, unchanged in an unchanging landscape.
