# The St. Augustine Civil Rights Campaign
## 1963-1964

---

## Overview

In 1963-1964, St. Augustine, Florida—the nation's oldest city—became one of the most dramatic battlegrounds of the civil rights movement. Local activists led by Dr. Robert Hayling, and later joined by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), challenged the deeply entrenched segregation of this historic tourist destination. The campaign featured mass marches, sit-ins, "wade-ins" at segregated beaches, and brutal violence from white supremacists, all playing out before national media as the city prepared to celebrate its 400th anniversary. The St. Augustine campaign helped push Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, making it one of the most consequential—and most dangerous—battles of the movement.
