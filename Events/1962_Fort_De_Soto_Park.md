# Fort De Soto Park: Tampa Bay's Island Treasure
## 1962-Present

---

## Overview

Fort De Soto Park, encompassing 1,136 acres across five interconnected islands at the southern tip of the Pinellas peninsula, consistently ranks among the nation's finest beach parks. Established in 1962 as a Pinellas County park, Fort De Soto combines pristine Gulf beaches, mangrove habitat, and historic fortifications from the Spanish-American War era. The park's seven miles of waterfront, award-winning beach, and extensive recreational facilities attract millions of visitors annually, while its strategic location at the mouth of Tampa Bay preserves both military history and critical coastal habitat. Named for the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto who landed nearby in 1539, the park connects Florida's distant past to its recreational present.
