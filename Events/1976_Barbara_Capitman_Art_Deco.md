# Barbara Capitman and the Saving of Art Deco Miami Beach
## 1976-1990

---

## Overview

In the 1970s, Miami Beach's South Beach was a decaying neighborhood of elderly retirees living in faded 1930s hotels that developers wanted to demolish and replace with high-rises. Barbara Baer Capitman saw something different: an architectural treasure trove worthy of preservation. Almost single-handedly, she launched a campaign to save the Art Deco District, founding the Miami Design Preservation League and fighting developers, politicians, and skeptics who thought she was crazy. In 1979, her efforts led to the creation of the nation's first 20th-century historic district. Today, the pastel-painted Art Deco hotels she saved define Miami Beach's world-famous image, and the neighborhood she rescued is one of America's most vibrant. Capitman died in 1990, just as her vision was being realized.
