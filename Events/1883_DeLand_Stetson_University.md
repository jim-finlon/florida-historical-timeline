# DeLand and Stetson University: The Athens of Florida
## 1883-Present

---

## Overview

Henry DeLand, a baking soda magnate from New York, arrived in Florida in 1876 and founded the town that bears his name—envisioning a cultured, educated community that would be the "Athens of Florida." In 1883, he established DeLand Academy, which grew into Stetson University, Florida's oldest private university. When DeLand's business failed in the 1885 freeze, hat manufacturer John B. Stetson stepped in to save the school. Today, Stetson's palm-shaded campus of Mediterranean and Romanesque buildings remains one of Florida's most beautiful, and DeLand retains its character as a graceful college town built on one man's vision of Florida as a place for culture and learning.
