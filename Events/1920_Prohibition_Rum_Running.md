# Rum Running in Florida: Prohibition's Wettest State
## 1920-1933

---

## Overview

When Prohibition became law on January 17, 1920, banning the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol, Florida found itself uniquely positioned to become the nation's primary supplier of illegal liquor. With 1,200 miles of coastline, proximity to rum-producing Cuba and the Bahamas, thousands of isolated inlets and islands, and a population largely hostile to the "dry" law, Florida became the rum runner's paradise. From Key West to Jacksonville, smugglers brought in boatloads of liquor, making fortunes and creating a culture of lawlessness that shaped Florida's character. By the time Prohibition ended in 1933, rum running had transformed quiet fishing villages into smuggling ports and made millionaires of men who'd been broke when the Noble Experiment began.
