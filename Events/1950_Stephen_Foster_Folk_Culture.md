# Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center: Way Down Upon the Swanee River
## 1935-Present

---

## Overview

Stephen Collins Foster never visited Florida. Yet his 1851 song "Old Folks at Home" ("Way Down Upon the Swanee River") became Florida's state song and made the Suwannee River famous around the world. Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park in White Springs, established in 1935, honors America's first great popular songwriter at the banks of the river he immortalized without ever seeing. The park features a museum of Foster memorabilia, a 97-bell carillon tower that plays his songs, and the Florida Folk Festival—the oldest continuous folk festival in the nation, celebrating the state's musical heritage every Memorial Day weekend since 1953.
