# The Suwannee River: Florida's Storied Stream
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

The Suwannee River flows 246 miles from Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp to the Gulf of Mexico, passing through one of Florida's most unspoiled landscapes—spring-fed waters, limestone banks, and forests that have changed little since the Timucua paddled these waters. Stephen Foster immortalized the river in "Old Folks at Home" (1851), making "Way Down Upon the Swanee River" one of America's most recognized songs, even though Foster never saw the river he made famous. Today, the Suwannee remains one of Florida's wildest waterways, its springs, parks, and small towns preserving a Florida that development has largely erased elsewhere.
