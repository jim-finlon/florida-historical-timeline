# The Florida Citrus Industry
## From Spanish Missionaries to Orange Juice Empire

---

## Overview

Florida's citrus industry began with Spanish missionaries planting orange seeds in the 1500s and grew into one of the most powerful agricultural industries in American history. By the 20th century, Florida produced 70% of America's oranges and spawned an empire of growers, packers, marketers, and the frozen concentrated orange juice that transformed breakfast tables across the nation. The industry shaped Florida's economy, landscape, politics, and identity—"The Sunshine State" became synonymous with oranges. But devastating freezes, foreign competition, and development have repeatedly challenged the industry, making the story of Florida citrus one of boom, bust, resilience, and transformation.

## The Origins

### Spanish Introduction

**The First Oranges:**
- Spanish explorers brought citrus seeds (1500s)
- Missionaries planted groves around missions
- Oranges naturalized in Florida's climate
- Wild groves spread

**Early Varieties:**
- Sour oranges (Seville type)
- Used for juice, marmalade
- Not sweet eating oranges
- Foundation stock for later grafting

### Early American Period

**Before Statehood:**
- Small groves around St. Augustine
- Some commercial production
- Limited market (transportation difficult)
- Mostly local consumption

**After Statehood (1845):**
- Production expanded
- Groves planted along rivers (transportation)
- New varieties introduced
- Beginning of commercial industry

## The Industry Develops

### Post-Civil War Growth

**The Expansion:**
- Northern investors came south
- Land cheap after the war
- Railroads promised connection to markets
- Citrus seemed like gold

**The Pioneer Growers:**
- Established groves in Central Florida
- Orange, Lake, Polk counties
- Indian River region (premium fruit)
- Built fortunes—and lost them

### The Railroad Connection

**Flagler and Plant:**
- Railroads reached citrus regions (1880s)
- Could ship fresh fruit north
- Markets opened dramatically
- Citrus became Florida's leading export

**The Trade:**
- Fresh fruit packed in wooden crates
- Shipped by refrigerated rail cars
- Northern cities hungry for oranges
- Florida became "Orange State"

## The Great Freezes

### The Pattern

**Florida's Vulnerability:**
- Subtropical, not tropical
- Occasional Arctic outbreaks
- Citrus trees damaged below 28°F
- Fruit destroyed, trees killed

### The Freeze of 1894-1895

**The Disaster:**
- December 1894: Hard freeze damaged trees
- February 1895: Killing freeze finished them
- Groves destroyed from Jacksonville to south of Orlando
- Industry nearly wiped out in North and Central Florida

**The Response:**
- Growers moved south
- New groves in warmer areas
- Industry rebuilt further down peninsula
- Julia Tuttle's unfrozen orange blossoms brought Flagler to Miami

### The Freeze of 1899

**More Damage:**
- Struck recovering industry
- Pushed groves further south
- Demonstrated ongoing risk
- Pattern established

### Later Freezes

**Major Freeze Events:**

| Year | Damage |
|------|--------|
| 1894-95 | Destroyed North/Central Florida citrus |
| 1899 | Further damage to recovering groves |
| 1962 | Severe damage |
| 1983 | Destroyed many Central Florida groves |
| 1985 | "Christmas Freeze" devastated industry |
| 1989 | Another major blow |

**The 1980s Disasters:**
- 1983, 1985, 1989 freezes
- Destroyed billions of dollars in groves
- Industry never fully recovered in Central Florida
- Groves moved to South Florida or sold for development

- USDA scientists in Florida developed process
- Could freeze juice concentrate
- Reconstitute with water at home
- Revolutionary product

**The Impact:**

- Massive demand increase
- Growers had stable market
- Industry transformed

### The Marketing

**Anita Bryant (1969-1980):**

### Peak Production

**The Numbers:**
| Decade | Florida Production |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1950s | 100+ million boxes annually |
| 1970s | 200+ million boxes |
| 1980s | 200+ million (before freezes) |
| Today | 50-70 million boxes |

## The Regions

### Central Florida

**The Heart:**
- Polk, Lake, Orange, Highlands counties
- Historic citrus center
- Rolling hills provided frost drainage

### Southwest Florida

**The Growth Area:**
- Collier, Hendry counties
- Warmer, fewer freezes
- Expanded as Central Florida declined
- Major production area today

## Challenges

### The Freezes

**The Pattern:**
- Every few decades, devastating freeze
- Trees killed, replanting required
- Years to regain production
- Insurance and government relief critical

### Foreign Competition

**Brazil:**
- Became major producer
- Lower labor costs
- Fewer freezes
- Now world's largest producer

**Mexico and Others:**
- Fresh fruit competition
- Lower costs
- Tariff battles

- Trees decline and die
- Fruit quality reduced
- Production dropped dramatically
- No cure found yet

### Development Pressure

**Land Values:**
- Groves worth more as subdivisions
- Especially near cities
- Growers sold out
- Orange groves became housing tracts

---

## Cultural Impact
