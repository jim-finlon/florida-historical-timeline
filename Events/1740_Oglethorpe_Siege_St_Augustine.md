# Oglethorpe's Siege of St. Augustine: Georgia Attacks Florida
## 1740

---

## Overview

The 1740 Siege of St. Augustine marked the most serious British attempt to capture the Spanish colonial capital before Florida finally changed hands in 1763. General James Edward Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, led a combined force of British regulars, colonial militia, and Native American allies in a 38-day siege that once again tested the Castillo de San Marcos. Despite overwhelming numbers and a determined effort, Oglethorpe failed to breach the coquina fortress, and the arrival of Spanish reinforcements from Havana forced his withdrawal. The siege represented the climax of Anglo-Spanish hostilities in the War of Jenkins' Ear and demonstrated Spain's ability to hold Florida against British expansion.
