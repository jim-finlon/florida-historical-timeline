# Ybor City and the Cigar Industry
## 1886-1960s

---

## Overview

In 1886, Spanish-born cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez-Ybor moved his operations from Key West to a patch of scrubland east of Tampa, creating an instant city named for himself. Within a decade, Ybor City became the "Cigar Capital of the World," producing over 100 million hand-rolled cigars annually. The industry attracted thousands of immigrants—Cubans, Spaniards, and Italians—who created a unique Latin community in the American South. With its mutual aid societies, radical politics, cigar factory "readers," and distinctive culture, Ybor City was unlike any other American neighborhood. Though mechanization and changing tastes eventually devastated the industry, Ybor's legacy survives in Tampa's heritage, architecture, and identity.
