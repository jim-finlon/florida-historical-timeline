# Tampa Museum of Art: From Greek Antiquities to Contemporary Vision
## 1979-Present

---

## Overview

The Tampa Museum of Art, housed since 2010 in a striking waterfront building designed by Stanley Saitowitz, combines a world-class collection of Greek and Roman antiquities with vibrant contemporary art programming in the heart of downtown Tampa. The museum's origins trace to 1920 when the Tampa Art Institute was founded, evolving through several incarnations before emerging as the Tampa Museum of Art in 1979. The current building, a luminous structure along the Tampa Riverwalk, exemplifies the city's cultural renaissance and serves as a beacon for the visual arts on Florida's Gulf Coast.
