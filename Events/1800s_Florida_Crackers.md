# The Florida Crackers: Original Settlers of the Frontier
## 1800s-Present

---

## Overview

Long before tourists discovered Florida's beaches, before developers drained the swamps, before railroads connected the coasts, a hardy breed of settlers carved out a living in Florida's pine woods and prairies. Known as "Florida Crackers," these pioneers—many descended from colonial-era settlers of Georgia and the Carolinas—developed a distinct culture adapted to the subtropical frontier. They raised cattle on the open range, hunted and fished for subsistence, built distinctive homes designed for the climate, and spoke a dialect that blended Southern mountain speech with local innovation. The term "Cracker" itself, once proudly claimed, reflects this heritage: likely derived from the crack of the cow whip used to drive cattle, or perhaps from the cracked corn that was a dietary staple.
