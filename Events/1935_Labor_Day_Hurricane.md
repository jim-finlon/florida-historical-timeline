# The Labor Day Hurricane
## September 2, 1935

---

## Overview

On September 2, 1935, the most intense hurricane ever to strike the United States made landfall in the Florida Keys. The Labor Day Hurricane, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds over 185 mph and a barometric pressure of 26.35 inches (the lowest ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere at landfall), devastated the Middle Keys and killed over 400 people. Many of the victims were World War I veterans working in federal relief camps on the Keys, their deaths sparking national controversy about the government's failure to evacuate them in time. The storm also destroyed Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad, ending the rail connection to Key West forever.
