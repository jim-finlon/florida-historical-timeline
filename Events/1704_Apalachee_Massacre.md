# The Destruction of the Apalachee Missions
## 1704

---

## Overview

In 1704, a British colonial force from Carolina under Colonel James Moore, allied with Creek and Yamasee warriors, swept through the Spanish mission province of Apalachee in present-day Tallahassee region, destroying a 100-year-old mission system, killing or enslaving thousands of Apalachee Indians, and effectively ending Spanish control of northern Florida. The raids were part of Queen Anne's War, the American theater of the War of Spanish Succession, but their immediate cause was the slave trade—the British needed captives to sell in Charleston. The destruction of Apalachee marked the end of a distinctive world where Spanish friars and Native Americans had created a hybrid culture, and it opened the way for British expansion into the Southeast.
