# The Siege of St. Augustine: Queen Anne's War Comes to Florida
## 1702

---

## Overview

The Siege of St. Augustine in November-December 1702 marked the first major military engagement of Queen Anne's War in the American colonies, when South Carolina forces under Colonel James Moore besieged the Spanish colonial capital of Florida. For nearly two months, approximately 1,500 residents of St. Augustine sheltered within the walls of the Castillo de San Marcos while English and Creek Indian forces burned the town and blockaded the harbor. The arrival of Spanish relief ships from Havana forced Moore to abandon the siege, burn his own ships, and retreat overland—but not before destroying virtually everything in St. Augustine outside the castle walls. The siege proved both the impregnability of the coquina fortress and the vulnerability of Spanish Florida.
