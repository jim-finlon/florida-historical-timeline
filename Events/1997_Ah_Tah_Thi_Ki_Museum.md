# Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Museum: The Seminole Story in Their Own Words
## 1997-Present

---

## Overview

Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Museum, whose name means "a place to learn" in the Seminole language, is the Seminole Tribe of Florida's premier cultural institution, presenting the story of the Unconquered People from their own perspective. Located on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation deep in the Everglades, the museum tells the remarkable saga of a people who never surrendered to the United States government—the only Native American tribe to never sign a peace treaty. Through exhibits, a living village, a one-mile boardwalk through cypress swamp, and programming led by tribal members, Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki preserves and shares Seminole history, art, and traditions. Opened in 1997, the museum represents the Seminole Tribe's commitment to controlling and sharing their own narrative.
