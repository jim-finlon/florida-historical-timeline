# Geronimo at Fort Pickens: The Apache Prisoners of Pensacola
## 1886-1888

---

## Overview

In October 1886, the legendary Apache warrior Geronimo and his band of fighters arrived in chains at Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island near Pensacola, Florida—as far from their Arizona homeland as the U.S. government could send them while remaining in the country. For eighteen months, Geronimo and his warriors were held as prisoners of war in the old masonry fort, becoming unlikely tourist attractions as thousands of curious Floridians crossed the bay to catch a glimpse of the famous "savage." Their imprisonment at Fort Pickens was part of a shameful chapter in which the government separated Apache families, sending women and children to a different fort in Florida while keeping the warriors isolated. Geronimo would never return to Arizona, dying in captivity in Oklahoma in 1909.
