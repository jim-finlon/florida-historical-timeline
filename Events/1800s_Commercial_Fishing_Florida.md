# Florida Commercial Fishing: From the Sea to the Table
## 1800s-Present

---

## Overview

Florida's commercial fishing industry has supplied seafood to local and national markets since the 1800s, capitalizing on the state's 8,400 miles of coastline and access to both Atlantic and Gulf waters. From mullet and grouper to stone crab and spiny lobster, Florida's commercial fishermen have harvested the bounty of warm subtropical waters for generations. While facing ongoing challenges from environmental changes, regulations, and shifting markets, commercial fishing remains an important part of Florida's coastal economy and cultural identity, with working waterfronts from Pensacola to Key West.
