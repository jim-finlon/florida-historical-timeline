# The Cross-Florida Barge Canal: A Dream Defeated
## 1935-1990

---

## Overview

For over a century, boosters dreamed of cutting a canal across Florida, connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean. The Cross-Florida Barge Canal, authorized in 1935 and begun in earnest in 1964, was to be that dream realized. But environmentalists, led by Marjorie Harris Carr, fought the project and achieved something unprecedented: they convinced President Nixon to halt construction in 1971, killing a major Army Corps of Engineers project in mid-construction. The fight over the canal became a landmark environmental battle, one of the first times environmental concerns stopped a major federal project. Today, the abandoned canal route is the Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway, a 110-mile conservation corridor.

## The Dream

### The Idea

**The Concept:**
- Canal across Florida peninsula
- Connect Gulf to Atlantic
- Avoid dangerous Florida Keys passage
- Ship traffic shortcut

**The History:**
- Spanish considered it (1500s)
- Americans proposed it (1820s)
- Multiple failed attempts
- Dream persisted

### The Route

**The Geography:**
- From Yankeetown on Gulf (Withlacoochee River)
- Across Florida through Ocala
- To Palatka on St. Johns River
- To Atlantic at Jacksonville

**The Obstacles:**
- Central Florida highlands
- Ocala Limestone (aquifer)
- Silver Springs
- Rivers and wetlands

### The Rationale

**The Arguments For:**
- Shorter shipping route
- Avoid Florida Straits
- Economic development
- Jobs and commerce

**The Reality:**
- Declining barge traffic nationally
- Container ships too large for canal
- Economic projections questionable
- But politics trumped economics

## The Authorization

### 1935: The Beginning

**The Authorization:**
- Rivers and Harbors Act of 1935
- Authorized as ship canal
- Depression-era project
- Jobs program as much as infrastructure

**The Work:**
- Some construction 1935-1936
- Funds ran out
- World War II intervened
- Project suspended

### The Postwar Push

**The Advocates:**
- Florida politicians (George Smathers, Spessard Holland)
- Army Corps of Engineers
- Business interests
- Water management districts

**The Opposition (Early):**
- Environmental concerns nascent
- Some local opposition
- Economists skeptical
- But momentum built

## Construction Begins

### 1964: Groundbreaking

**The Design:**
- 107 miles long
- 12 feet deep, 150 feet wide
- Series of locks
- Cut through central Florida

### The Work

**What Was Built:**
- Rodman Dam and Reservoir (16,000 acres)
- Eureka Dam and Reservoir
- Miles of channel dug
- Significant destruction

**The Progress:**
- By 1971: 28% complete
- $74 million spent
- Ocklawaha River dammed
- Forests flooded

### The Destruction

**The Ocklawaha River:**
- Beautiful river flooded
- Old-growth forest destroyed
- Springs covered
- Ecosystem devastated

**Rodman Reservoir:**
- 16,000 acres of forest flooded
- Dead trees standing in water
- Created bass fishing but destroyed river
- Controversial to this day

- Unprecedented environmental review

### The Coalition

**The Groups:**
- Florida Defenders of the Environment
- Sierra Club

## The Victory

### Nixon's Order

**January 19, 1971:**
- President Nixon ordered halt to construction
- Cited environmental concerns
- First time president stopped Corps project for environment
- Landmark moment

**The Statement:**
- Environmental damage too great
- Economic benefits too uncertain
- Stop construction
- Unprecedented

### The Aftermath

**The Reaction:**
- Environmentalists celebrated
- Florida politicians furious
- Corps stunned
- National attention

**The Limbo:**
- Construction stopped but not cancelled
- Project in legal limbo
- Advocates tried to restart
- Debate continued

### Deauthorization

**1990:**
- Congress finally deauthorized canal
- Project officially dead
- After 55 years of debate
- Environmental movement victorious

## The Legacy

### The Greenway

**Today:**
- Cross Florida Greenway (renamed for Marjorie Harris Carr)
- 110-mile recreational corridor
- Hiking, biking, horseback riding
- Conservation area

**The Transformation:**
- Canal route became park
- Failure became success
- Destruction partially restored
- New use for old mistake

### Rodman Dam Debate

**The Controversy Continues:**
- Dam still in place
- Reservoir still exists
- Environmental groups want dam removed
- Fishermen want it kept

**The Arguments:**
- Removal would restore Ocklawaha River
- Removal would hurt bass fishing
- Dead trees still in reservoir
- Fight continues today
