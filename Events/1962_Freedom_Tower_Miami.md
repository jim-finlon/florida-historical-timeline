# The Freedom Tower: Ellis Island of the South
## 1962-1974

---

## Overview

From 1962 to 1974, the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami served as the primary processing center for the nearly half-million Cuban refugees who fled Castro's revolution. The elegant 1925 Mediterranean Revival building—originally the home of the Miami Daily News—became the first stop in America for families who had left everything behind. Here, refugees received medical examinations, documentation, resettlement assistance, and their first meals on American soil. For the Cuban exile community, the Freedom Tower is sacred ground, their Ellis Island, the symbol of their American journey. Today it stands as a National Historic Landmark, a monument to the refugee experience and Miami's transformation into a bicultural metropolis.
