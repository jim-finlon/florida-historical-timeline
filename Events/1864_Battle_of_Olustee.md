# The Battle of Olustee: Florida's Bloodiest Day
## February 20, 1864

---

## Overview

On February 20, 1864, in the pine woods near Olustee Station in Baker County, approximately 5,500 Union soldiers clashed with a roughly equal number of Confederates in the largest battle fought in Florida during the Civil War. After several hours of fierce combat, the Union forces broke and retreated, leaving behind a field strewn with dead and wounded. The Confederate victory ensured that Florida's interior—with its cattle, salt, and supplies—would remain in Southern hands for the rest of the war. The battle was one of the bloodiest of the Civil War relative to the size of the forces engaged.

## The Setting

### Florida's Strategic Value

By 1864, Florida had become important to the Confederacy:

**Resources:**
- Cattle: Beef for hungry Confederate armies
- Salt: Essential for food preservation
- Foodstuffs: Corn, pork, and other provisions
- Cotton: Valuable for export

**Geography:**
- Long coastline made complete blockade impossible
- Interior was difficult for Union forces to reach
- Distance from main theaters of war provided protection

### Union Objectives

The Union had multiple reasons for invading Florida:

**Military:**
- Cut off Confederate supplies
- Recruit Black soldiers
- Disrupt Confederate operations

**Political:**
- Restore Florida to the Union
- Establish loyal government
- (Possibly) deliver electoral votes for Lincoln in 1864

**Humanitarian:**
- Free enslaved people
- Enlist freed men in Union army
- Demonstrate freedom behind Confederate lines

## The Story

### The Union Advance

**February 7, 1864:**
- Union forces landed at Jacksonville
- Fourth occupation of the city during the war
- Began pushing inland

**The March:**
- Seymour's forces moved west along the Florida, Atlantic & Gulf Central Railroad
- Met little resistance initially
- Confederates fell back, concentrating their forces

**Intelligence Failure:**
- Seymour believed he faced only weak opposition
- Did not know Finegan had assembled a substantial force
- Pressed forward despite warnings

### The Battlefield

**Olustee (Ocean Pond):**
- Pine flatwoods east of Lake City
- Open pine woods with palmetto understory
- Railroad running through the area
- Swampy ground on both flanks limited maneuver

**Confederate Position:**
- Finegan chose his ground carefully
- Swamps protected his flanks
- Clear fields of fire through the pines
- Infantry entrenched behind earthworks and fallen timber

### The Battle

**Early Afternoon, February 20:**
- Union forces approached the Confederate position
- Seymour sent units forward piecemeal rather than in coordinated assault
- Each unit was engaged and shot up before the next arrived

**The Fighting:**
For several hours, combat raged in the pine woods:

- **7th New Hampshire:** First engaged; suffered 211 casualties of 554 men
- **8th USCT:** Thrown into action; lost 310 of 554 men
- **54th Massachusetts:** Fought heroically; helped cover the retreat
- **35th USCT:** Suffered heavy losses defending the Union line

**The Crisis:**
- By late afternoon, Union line began to crumble
- Units ran low on ammunition
- Casualties mounted
- Seymour ordered retreat

### The Retreat

**The Withdrawal:**
- Union forces retreated toward Jacksonville
- Confederates pursued but could not destroy the retreating army
- Fighting continued into darkness

**Covering the Retreat:**
- 54th Massachusetts and 35th USCT formed rearguard
- Repulsed Confederate cavalry charges
- Saved the army from complete disaster

**Union:**

**Confederate:**
