# Ichetucknee Springs: Florida's Crystal River
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

The Ichetucknee River is a six-mile ribbon of impossibly clear water fed by eight major springs that together pump 233 million gallons of 72-degree water daily. For thousands of years, Native Americans lived along its banks, and early explorers marveled at its clarity. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Ichetucknee became one of Florida's most popular tubing destinations, with thousands floating downstream daily—until it became clear the river was being loved to death. Ichetucknee Springs State Park, established in 1970, now manages visitation to protect this irreplaceable natural treasure, offering one of Florida's most magical experiences: drifting through crystal waters while fish swim beneath you and turtles sun on logs.
