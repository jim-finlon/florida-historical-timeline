# Seaside: The Town That Changed American Planning
## 1981-Present

---

## Overview

Seaside, an 80-acre planned community on Florida's Panhandle coast, launched the New Urbanism movement and fundamentally challenged American suburban development patterns. Founded in 1981 by developer Robert Davis and designed by architects Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Seaside recreated the walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods of traditional small towns that had been abandoned in favor of automobile-dependent sprawl. The town's success—demonstrated both commercially and in its vibrant community life—inspired thousands of similar developments worldwide and influenced planning codes across the nation. Seaside's appearance in the 1998 film "The Truman Show" brought its distinctive pastel cottages and white picket fences to global attention.
