# Koreshan State Park: The Hollow Earth Colony
## 1894-Present

---

## Overview

Koreshan State Park in Estero preserves the remarkable remains of a 19th-century utopian community founded on the belief that humans live on the inside surface of a hollow Earth. Led by Cyrus Teed, who styled himself "Koresh," the Koreshan Unity established a self-sufficient settlement in 1894 that at its peak included 250 members living communally, practicing celibacy, and working toward the creation of a "New Jerusalem" in Southwest Florida. Today, eleven restored buildings, tropical gardens, and the community's elaborate cosmological equipment stand as testament to one of Florida's most unusual social experiments.
