# The Florida Keys: America's Caribbean Islands
## 1822-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida Keys, an archipelago of over 1,700 islands curving 120 miles southwest from the Florida mainland into the Straits of Florida, represent one of America's most unique regions—geographically, culturally, and ecologically. From the wrecking industry and cigar factories of 19th-century Key West to the fishing villages of Islamorada and the artist colonies of the Upper Keys, these coral and limestone islands have attracted pirates, presidents, writers, and refugees. Connected since 1912 by Flagler's audacious Overseas Railroad and since 1938 by the Overseas Highway, the Keys remain a world apart—America's only living coral reef, the Conch Republic, and the end of U.S. Route 1.
