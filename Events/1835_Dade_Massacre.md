# The Dade Massacre: Beginning of the Second Seminole War
## December 28, 1835

---

## Overview

On the morning of December 28, 1835, a column of 108 U.S. Army soldiers under Major Francis L. Dade was ambushed by Seminole warriors near present-day Bushnell, Florida. Within hours, all but three soldiers were dead—the worst defeat the U.S. Army would suffer in Florida and one of the deadliest attacks on American troops in the Indian Wars. The Dade Massacre, as it came to be known, ignited the Second Seminole War, the longest and most costly Indian war in American history, lasting seven years and costing 1,500 American lives and $40 million. Today the site is preserved as Dade Battlefield Historic State Park.
