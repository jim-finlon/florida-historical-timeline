# St. Petersburg: The Sunshine City
## 1888-Present

---

## Overview

St. Petersburg, founded in 1888 on the western shore of Tampa Bay, transformed from a small railroad terminus into one of Florida's most vibrant cities—known worldwide as "The Sunshine City" for its record-setting consecutive sunny days. The city pioneered the concept of retirement destination tourism, marketed aggressively to Northern snowbirds, and later reinvented itself as a cultural hub with world-class museums including the Salvador Dalí Museum. From its famous green benches to its revitalized downtown waterfront, St. Petersburg represents Florida's evolution from winter resort to year-round metropolitan center.
