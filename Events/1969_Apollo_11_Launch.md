# Apollo 11 Launches from Kennedy Space Center
## July 16, 1969

---

## Overview

On July 16, 1969, at 9:32 AM Eastern Daylight Time, the Saturn V rocket carrying Apollo 11 lifted off from Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, beginning humanity's first journey to land on the Moon. Four days later, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on another world, while Michael Collins orbited above in the command module. The launch from Florida's Space Coast fulfilled President Kennedy's 1961 challenge to land a man on the Moon before the decade's end, and cemented Florida's place at the center of America's space program.

## The Setting

### Kennedy's Challenge

The Apollo program began with a presidential commitment:

**May 25, 1961:**
President John F. Kennedy addressed Congress:
> "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."

**The Context:**
- Soviet Union had launched first satellite (Sputnik, 1957)
- Soviets sent first human to space (Yuri Gagarin, April 1961)
- Cold War space race in full intensity
- American prestige at stake

### Kennedy Space Center

Florida's "Space Coast" was the launch site:

**Why Florida:**
- Location near equator maximizes Earth's rotational boost
- Launches over open Atlantic Ocean
- Existing facilities at Cape Canaveral
- Year-round launch capability

**The Facilities:**
- Launch Complex 39 built for Saturn V
- Vehicle Assembly Building (still one of world's largest structures)
- 3.5-mile crawlerway for transporting rockets
- Mission Control (primary at Houston; backup at Cape)

### The Saturn V Rocket

The most powerful rocket ever to fly:

**Specifications:**
- Height: 363 feet (taller than 36-story building)
- Weight (fueled): 6.2 million pounds
- Thrust: 7.5 million pounds
- Three stages

**The Vehicle:**
- First stage (S-IC): Five F-1 engines
- Second stage (S-II): Five J-2 engines
- Third stage (S-IVB): One J-2 engine
- Lunar module: "Eagle"
- Command module: "Columbia"

### Liftoff

**T-0, 9:32:00 AM EDT:**

The five F-1 engines ignited. Flames and smoke billowed from the launch pad. For a moment that seemed to last forever, the rocket sat motionless as thrust built. Then it began to rise.

The sound reached the spectators seconds later—a physical force, a thunderous roar that shook chests and rattled windows miles away. The rocket climbed, slowly at first, then faster, trailing a pillar of fire.

Millions watched on television. Around the world, people stopped what they were doing to witness history.

**Armstrong's Calm Voice:**
> "Roger, clock is running... Roll and pitch program. This is Apollo 11."

**The Ascent:**
- First stage burned for 2 minutes, 41 seconds
- Separation at 38 miles altitude
- Second stage took over
- Third stage achieved Earth orbit

### The Journey

**Earth Orbit to Moon:**
- Third stage reignited for "trans-lunar injection"
- Three-day journey to the Moon
- Mid-course corrections as needed
- Television broadcasts sent home

**Lunar Orbit:**
- July 19: Apollo 11 entered lunar orbit
- Circled the Moon, preparing for landing

### The Landing

**July 20, 1969:**
- Armstrong and Aldrin entered lunar module "Eagle"
- Separated from command module
- Descended toward the Moon's surface

**The Descent:**
- Computer alarms during final minutes
- Armstrong took manual control
- Searched for safe landing site
- Running low on fuel

**"Contact Light":**
At 4:17 PM EDT, a probe beneath Eagle touched the lunar surface.

**Armstrong's Words:**
> "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."

**Mission Control:**
> "Roger, Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again."

### The Moonwalk

**6 Hours Later:**
- Armstrong climbed down the ladder
- Stepped onto the lunar surface at 10:56 PM EDT

**The Words:**
> "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."

**Buzz Aldrin followed:**
- Described the view as "magnificent desolation"
- Both astronauts conducted experiments
- Planted American flag
- Collected samples
- Walked on the Moon for about 2.5 hours

### The Return

**July 21:**
- Eagle lifted off from the Moon
- Rendezvoused with Columbia (Collins)
- Astronauts transferred to command module
- Eagle jettisoned

**The Journey Home:**
- Three-day return flight
