# Meyer Lansky and the Mob in Florida
## 1936-1983

---

## Overview

Meyer Lansky, the "Mob's Accountant" and one of the most powerful organized crime figures in American history, made Florida his home and his playground. From the 1930s through the 1970s, Lansky ran gambling operations from Havana to Hollywood, Florida, built legitimate businesses in Miami Beach, and helped transform South Florida into a haven for both respectable retirees and not-so-respectable money. Unlike the flamboyant Al Capone, Lansky operated quietly, rarely facing prosecution, and died in Miami Beach at 80—in modest circumstances despite having allegedly controlled billions. His story intertwines with Florida's development as both vacation paradise and organized crime capital.
