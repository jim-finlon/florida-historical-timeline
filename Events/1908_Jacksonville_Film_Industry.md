# Jacksonville: The First Hollywood
## Florida's Forgotten Film Capital, 1908-1920

---

## Overview

Before Hollywood dominated American cinema, Jacksonville, Florida, was the film capital of the United States. From 1908 to 1920, more than 30 movie studios operated in Jacksonville, producing hundreds of films and employing thousands of workers. The city offered what filmmakers needed: year-round sunshine for outdoor shooting, diverse locations from beaches to swamps, cheap labor, and a welcoming business environment. Stars like Oliver Hardy (before Stan Laurel), Clara Bow, and many others made films in Jacksonville. But a combination of factors—including a reformist mayor who saw movies as sinful, the rise of California, and World War I disruptions—ended Jacksonville's film era. Hollywood went west, and Jacksonville's moment as America's film capital was largely forgotten.
