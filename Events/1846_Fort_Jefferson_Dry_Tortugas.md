# Fort Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas
## 1846-Present

---

## Overview

Seventy miles west of Key West, in the remote Dry Tortugas islands, stands Fort Jefferson—the largest masonry structure in the Americas. Built between 1846 and 1875 but never completed, this massive hexagonal fortress was designed to protect the vital sea lanes between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Though never tested in battle, Fort Jefferson gained notoriety as a Civil War prison, where Dr. Samuel Mudd was imprisoned for setting John Wilkes Booth's broken leg. Today, Fort Jefferson is a national park, accessible only by boat or seaplane, one of the most remote and hauntingly beautiful places in the United States.
