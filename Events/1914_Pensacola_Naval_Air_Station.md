# Pensacola Naval Air Station: The Cradle of Naval Aviation
## 1914-Present

---

## Overview

In 1914, the United States Navy established its first permanent aviation facility at Pensacola, Florida, creating what would become known as "The Cradle of Naval Aviation." For over a century, Naval Air Station Pensacola has trained virtually every Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard aviator, including seven astronauts who walked on the moon. From the primitive float planes of 1914 to the Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron based there today, Pensacola has been the birthplace of American naval air power. The station remains one of the most important military installations in the United States and the cornerstone of Pensacola's identity.
