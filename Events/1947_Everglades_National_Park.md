# The Everglades: From Swamp to National Park
## Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the River of Grass

---

## Overview

On December 6, 1947, President Harry Truman dedicated Everglades National Park, protecting 1.5 million acres of the vast wetland that once covered most of South Florida. The same year, journalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas published *The Everglades: River of Grass*, a lyrical history that transformed how Americans thought about the region—not as a worthless swamp to be drained, but as a unique and irreplaceable ecosystem. Douglas's book, and her subsequent decades of activism, helped save the Everglades from complete destruction and made her one of America's most celebrated environmentalists. The battle to protect and restore the Everglades continues today.

## Part One: What the Everglades Were

### The Original Ecosystem

**The Geography:**
- Covered approximately 4,000 square miles
- Extended from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay
- 50 miles wide, 100+ miles long
- Slow-moving sheet of water flowing southward

**"River of Grass":**
- Douglas's famous phrase
- Not stagnant swamp but moving water
- Sawgrass prairie
- Six inches deep, miles wide

**The Complexity:**
- Multiple habitats: sawgrass prairie, cypress swamps, mangroves
- Hammocks (tree islands)
- Sloughs (deeper water channels)
- Transition zones

### The Wildlife

**Remarkable Biodiversity:**
- Alligators and crocodiles (only place they coexist)
- Florida panther
- Manatees
- 360+ bird species
- Roseate spoonbills, egrets, herons
- Snook, tarpon, countless fish species

**The Birds:**
- Enormous rookeries
- Millions of wading birds
- Plume hunting nearly destroyed them
- Still recovering

### The Original People

**Calusa:**
- Dominated South Florida before Europeans
- Sophisticated water-based civilization
- Destroyed by disease and conflict

**Seminoles and Miccosukees:**
- Retreated to Everglades (19th century)
- Found refuge in "impenetrable" swamp
- Still live on reservations within/near Everglades

## Part Two: The Destruction

### "Reclamation"

**The Idea:**
- Drain the swamp
- Create farmland
- Make Florida "productive"
- Engineer nature

**Napoleon Bonaparte Broward:**
- Florida governor 1905-1909
- Ran on "Drain the Everglades" platform
- Began dredging and canal projects
- Promised agricultural bonanza

### The Drainage Projects

**Early Efforts (1905-1920s):**
- Canals dug from Lake Okeechobee
- Water diverted to sea
- Land "reclaimed" for agriculture
- Boom-era speculation

**The Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project (1948):**
- After 1947 flooding
- Massive engineering project
- 1,800 miles of canals
- 1,000+ miles of levees
- Fundamentally altered hydrology

**The Results:**
- Half of original Everglades lost
- Water diverted for cities and farms
- Flow patterns disrupted
- Ecosystem severely damaged

### The Impacts

**On Water:**
- Natural flow patterns destroyed
- Compartmentalized into water management areas
- Artificial drought and flood cycles
- Saltwater intrusion into aquifers

**On Wildlife:**
- Wading bird populations collapsed (90%+ decline)
- Florida panther nearly extinct
- Many species threatened
- Ecosystem unbalanced

**On Humans:**
- Short-term economic gains
- Long-term water supply threatened
- Lake Okeechobee pollution
- Everglades Agricultural Area created, but at cost

**The Opening Line:**
> "There are no other Everglades in the world. They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions of the earth..."

**The Impact:**
- Bestseller

### The Activist

**Friends of the Everglades (1969):**
- Founded at age 79
- Opposed jetport in Big Cypress
- Fought development proposals
- Tireless advocacy

**The Method:**
- Attended every meeting
- Spoke at every hearing
- Small, fierce, persistent
- Floppy hat became trademark

**The Longevity:**
- Active into her 100s
- Died at 108 (1998)
- Saw many victories
- Inspired new generations

## Part Four: The National Park

### The Campaign

**Early Advocacy:**
- Ernest Coe: "father of Everglades National Park"
- Campaigned from 1920s
- Fought political battles
- Finally successful

**Authorization:**
- Park authorized 1934
- But no money allocated
- Land acquisition slow
- Delayed by Depression and war

### Dedication (December 6, 1947)

**President Truman:**
- Dedicated the park
- First national park created for biology, not scenery
- Protected ecosystem, not just pretty views
- Revolutionary concept

**The Speech:**
> "Here is land, tranquil in its quiet beauty, serving not as the source of water, but as the last receiver of it. To its natural abundance we owe the spectacular plant and animal life that distinguishes this place from all others in our country."

### The Park Today

**Size:**
- 1.5 million acres
- Largest subtropical wilderness in U.S.
- UNESCO World Heritage Site
- International Biosphere Reserve

**Threats:**
- Water management outside park
- Pollution from agriculture
- Invasive species (pythons, Brazilian pepper)
- Climate change and sea level rise

### The Lesson

The Everglades story teaches:

1. **"Progress" has costs:** Drainage seemed rational but was disastrous
2. **Ecosystems are connected:** You can't isolate one part
3. **One voice matters:** Douglas changed everything
4. **Restoration is possible but hard:** Undoing damage takes generations
5. **The fight never ends:** Protection requires constant vigilance

## Marjory's Words

**Her Summary:**
> "The Everglades is a test. If we pass it, we may get to keep the planet."

**On Persistence:**
> "Be a nuisance where it counts. Do your part to inform and stimulate the public to join your crusade. Be depressed, discouraged, and disappointed at failure and the disheartening effects of ignorance, greed, corruption and bad politics — but never give up."
