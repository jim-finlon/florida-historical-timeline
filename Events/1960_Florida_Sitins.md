# Florida Sit-In Movement
## February - March 1960

---

## Overview

In February and March 1960, African American students across Florida launched sit-in demonstrations at segregated lunch counters, joining a movement that swept the South and transformed the civil rights struggle. Beginning just days after the famous Greensboro, North Carolina sit-ins, Florida students in Miami, Tampa, Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and other cities sat peacefully at "whites only" lunch counters demanding service. Though met with arrests, violence, and fierce resistance, the sit-ins marked a new phase of direct action that would ultimately force the desegregation of public accommodations and establish students as the vanguard of the civil rights movement.

- Four Black students sat at Woolworth's in Greensboro, NC
- Refused to leave when denied service
- Returned day after day
- National media covered story

**The Spread:**
- Within weeks, sit-ins spread across South
- Students in dozens of cities joined
- Florida students watching, organizing
- Ready to act

### Florida's Readiness

**Previous Activism:**

- Black colleges provided organized student bodies

**The Colleges:**
- Florida A&M University (Tallahassee)
