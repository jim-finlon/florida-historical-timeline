# Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse: Guiding Ships Through War and Peace
## 1860-Present

---

## Overview

The Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse, with its distinctive red-brown brick tower, has stood at the point where the Loxahatchee River meets the Atlantic since 1860—Florida's oldest lighthouse in continuous operation and a witness to the Civil War, Seminole trade, the railroad's arrival, and the transformation of South Florida from wilderness to metropolis. Designed by George Meade (later the Union general who won Gettysburg), the lighthouse survived Confederate attempts to darken it, saw the Celestial Railroad arrive, and watched as Palm Beach County grew around it. Today it stands as both a working aid to navigation and a beloved historical landmark.
