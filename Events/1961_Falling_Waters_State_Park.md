# Falling Waters State Park: Florida's Only Waterfall
## 1961-Present

---

## Overview

Falling Waters State Park in Washington County, deep in Florida's Panhandle, is home to the state's only waterfall—a 73-foot cascade that plunges into a cylindrical sinkhole 100 feet deep and 20 feet wide. This geological curiosity, where water falls into the earth rather than flowing across it, makes Falling Waters one of Florida's most unusual natural features. The park also preserves rolling Panhandle hills, longleaf pine forests, and remnants of Florida's brief oil boom in the 1920s. For visitors who think of Florida only as flat and tropical, Falling Waters offers a startling reminder of the state's geological diversity.
