# Highlands Hammock State Park: Florida's First State Park
## 1931-Present

---

## Overview

Highlands Hammock State Park, established in 1931, holds the distinction of being one of Florida's four original state parks and the first to be developed for public use. Located in Highlands County in the heart of the Florida peninsula, the park preserves a magnificent old-growth hardwood hammock—a cathedral of ancient live oaks draped in resurrection fern and Spanish moss, some over 1,000 years old. The park also protects pine flatwoods, cypress swamps, and scrubland that together harbor Florida black bears, white-tailed deer, and diverse birdlife. Its origins in the Great Depression, when local citizens raised funds to save the hammock from logging, make it a pioneering example of grassroots conservation in Florida.
