# The Barefoot Mailman
## 1885-1892

---

## Overview

Before roads connected the scattered settlements of South Florida's Atlantic coast, the U.S. Postal Service delivered mail the only way possible: on foot. From 1885 to 1892, a series of mail carriers walked a 68-mile route between Palm Beach and Miami, following the hard-packed sand of the beach, wading through inlets, and rowing across rivers. These "Barefoot Mailmen"—so called because they often removed their shoes to wade through water—became legendary figures in Florida history. The most famous, Edwin R. Hamilton, disappeared in 1887, presumably killed by an alligator or drowned while crossing the Hillsboro Inlet. The barefoot mail route ended when Henry Flagler's railroad reached Miami in 1896, but the image of the solitary mailman walking the wild Florida beach endures as a symbol of pioneer determination.
