# National Key Deer Refuge: Protecting the Tiniest Deer
## 1957-Present

---

## Overview

The National Key Deer Refuge on Big Pine Key and surrounding islands in the Florida Keys protects the Key deer—a miniature subspecies of white-tailed deer found nowhere else on Earth. Standing only 24-32 inches at the shoulder, these diminutive deer nearly vanished in the 1950s when hunting and habitat loss reduced the population to fewer than 50 animals. Established in 1957, the 9,200-acre refuge has nursed the population back to nearly 1,000 deer while protecting the unique pine rockland and hardwood hammock ecosystems of the Lower Keys. The Key deer have become beloved ambassadors for the Florida Keys, a reminder that even in paradise, wildlife needs protection.
