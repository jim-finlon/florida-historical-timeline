# The Freedom Flights: Cuba to Miami
## 1965-1973

---

## Overview

From 1965 to 1973, twice-daily flights between Varadero, Cuba, and Miami carried 340,000 Cuban refugees to freedom in the United States. The Freedom Flights—officially the Cuban Airlift—represented the largest organized refugee airlift in American history. After the Cuban Missile Crisis had halted emigration, Fidel Castro unexpectedly opened the port of Camarioca to anyone who wanted to leave, triggering a chaotic boat exodus. The U.S. and Cuban governments then negotiated an orderly airlift, with refugees leaving behind everything to start new lives in America. The flights transformed Miami into a Cuban exile capital and reshaped Florida's demographics and politics for generations.
