# Sea Turtle Conservation in Florida: Saving Ancient Mariners
## 1970s-Present

---

## Overview

Florida's beaches host more sea turtle nesting activity than anywhere else in the United States, with over 100,000 nests recorded in peak years across the state's Atlantic and Gulf coastlines. Since the Endangered Species Act of 1973, Florida has been at the forefront of sea turtle conservation, protecting nesting beaches, regulating coastal lighting, and requiring turtle excluder devices on shrimp nets. The loggerhead, green, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, and hawksbill sea turtles that nest and forage in Florida waters represent one of conservation's greatest success stories, though threats from climate change, plastic pollution, and coastal development continue to challenge recovery efforts.
