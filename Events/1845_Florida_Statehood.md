# Florida Becomes the 27th State
## March 3, 1845

---

## Overview

On March 3, 1845, President John Tyler signed the act admitting Florida to the Union as the 27th state. After 24 years as a territory—years marked by the devastating Second Seminole War, debates over slavery, and struggles to attract settlers—Florida finally achieved statehood. Admitted alongside Iowa to maintain the balance between slave and free states, Florida entered the Union as part of the slaveholding South, a status that would define its politics until the Civil War began just sixteen years later.

## The Setting

### Territorial Florida

By 1845, Florida had changed significantly since 1821:

**Population Growth:**
- 1821: approximately 8,000 non-native inhabitants
- 1830: approximately 34,730
- 1840: approximately 54,477
- 1845: approximately 66,500

**Geographic Distribution:**
- North Florida (plantation belt): most populated
- Middle Florida (around Tallahassee): political center
- East Florida (St. Augustine area): older settlements
- South Florida: largely unsettled (Seminole country)

**Economy:**
- Cotton plantations dominated North Florida
- Sugar and citrus in smaller quantities
- Subsistence farming for most settlers
- Enslaved population: approximately 25,000 (about 40% of total)

### The Slavery Question

Florida's path to statehood was entangled with national slavery debates:

**The Issue:**
- Would Florida be a slave or free state?
- Every new state admission raised this question
- Missouri Compromise (1820) had established precedent
- Sectional balance in Congress at stake

**Florida's Position:**
- Clearly a slave territory
- Plantation economy dependent on enslaved labor
- No question it would be a slave state
- Question was when and how to admit it

### The Statehood Movement

Floridians had sought statehood for years:

**Arguments for Statehood:**
- Self-government (territorial governors were appointed)
- Representation in Congress
- Control over local affairs
- Pride and status

**Obstacles:**
- Population still low
- Congress reluctant to upset sectional balance
- Second Seminole War had drained resources
- Some territorial benefits would be lost

## The Path to Admission

### The Constitutional Convention

**St. Joseph, Florida (December 1838 - January 1839):**
- 56 delegates assembled
- Wrote Florida's first state constitution
- Modeled on other southern state constitutions

**Key Provisions:**
- Protected slavery
- Limited voting to white males
- Established three branches of government
- Defined state boundaries

### Congressional Debates

The constitution was sent to Congress in 1839, but admission was delayed:

**The Balance Problem:**
- Every slave state admission must be paired with a free state
- No suitable free state was ready in 1839
- Florida waited while Congress argued

**The Solution: Iowa:**
- Iowa Territory was also seeking statehood
- Iowa would be a free state
- Pairing Florida and Iowa maintained balance
- Both would be admitted in 1845

### The Admission Act

**March 3, 1845:**
- Congress passed the act admitting Florida
- President John Tyler signed it
- Florida became the 27th state
- Iowa would follow in December 1846

## Florida in 1845

### A Portrait of the New State

**Geography:**
- Approximately 58,560 square miles
- Longest coastline of any Atlantic state
- Mostly undeveloped wilderness
- Two time zones' worth of territory

**Population:**
- Approximately 66,500 total
- 25,000+ enslaved people
- Small free Black population
- Concentrated in northern counties

**Counties:**
- 20 counties at statehood
- Most in North and Middle Florida
- South Florida virtually unorganized

**Economy:**
- Cotton king in North Florida
- Some sugar cultivation
- Subsistence farming
- Timber and naval stores
- Limited commerce

### The Enslaved Majority

In many counties, enslaved people outnumbered free:

**The Numbers:**
- Approximately 40% of population enslaved
- Higher percentages in plantation counties
- Enslaved labor built the economy
- The "peculiar institution" defined Florida society

**Their Experience:**
- Forced labor on cotton and sugar plantations
- No legal rights
- Families routinely separated
- Harsh physical punishment common
- Small minority achieved freedom

## Challenges Ahead

### Remaining Issues

Statehood did not solve Florida's problems:

**The Seminoles:**
- Third Seminole War would erupt (1855-1858)
- Removal never fully completed
- Conflict continued in South Florida

**Development:**
- Population still sparse
- Transportation primitive
- Investment needed for growth
- Would take decades to develop

**Sectional Crisis:**
- Florida joined the Union as a slave state
- Would secede in 1861
- Just 16 years of statehood before Civil War

### Looking Forward

From 1845, Florida would:

1. **Remain a slave state** until the Civil War
2. **Secede from the Union** (January 10, 1861)
3. **Suffer through Civil War and Reconstruction**
4. **Eventually develop** into a major American state
5. **Grow dramatically** in the 20th century

## Significance

### Last of the Atlantic Seaboard

Florida was the last Atlantic coast state admitted:

| State | Year |
|-------|------|
| Delaware | 1787 |
| New Jersey | 1787 |
| Georgia | 1788 |
| ... | ... |
| Maine | 1820 |
| **Florida** | **1845** |

### Part of the Old South

Florida's admission reinforced the South:

- Another slave state
- Another vote for southern interests
- Would join Confederacy in 1861
- Reconstruction would last until 1877

### The Start of American Florida

March 3, 1845, marks the true beginning of Florida as Americans know it:

- Self-governing state
- Part of the American federal system
- On path toward the modern Florida
- Though that development would take over a century

## Legacy

### The First State Constitution

The 1838/1839 constitution:

- Served until the Civil War
- Replaced by Confederate constitution (1861)

### Enduring Institutions

From 1845, Florida retained:

- **Tallahassee** as capital
- **County system** (expanded over time)
- **Legislative structure**
- **Basic governmental framework**

### Historical Memory

March 3 is:

- Florida's "birthday" as a state
- Not widely celebrated today
