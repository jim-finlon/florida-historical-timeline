# Cassadaga: The Psychic Capital of the World
## 1894-Present

---

## Overview

In the palmetto scrub of Volusia County lies Cassadaga, America's oldest continuously active spiritualist community. Founded in 1894 by New York medium George P. Colby—who claimed a spirit guide named Seneca led him to this precise location—Cassadaga has been home to mediums, healers, and those seeking contact with the spirit world for over 130 years. Today, this tiny community of 55 acres continues to offer readings, séances, and spiritual healing, drawing visitors from around the world to its quaint Victorian cottages and quiet, moss-draped streets. Cassadaga bills itself as "The Psychic Capital of the World."
