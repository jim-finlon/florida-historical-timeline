# Egmont Key: Guardian of Tampa Bay
## 1858-Present

---

## Overview

Egmont Key, a 440-acre island at the mouth of Tampa Bay, has served as a strategic military outpost, lighthouse station, quarantine station, and prisoner of war camp since the mid-19th century. Named for the Earl of Egmont by early British colonizers, the island's location at the entrance to one of Florida's largest natural harbors made it essential for navigation and defense. Today, Egmont Key State Park and National Wildlife Refuge preserve the historic Fort Dade fortifications, a functioning lighthouse dating to 1858, and a fragile natural habitat increasingly threatened by erosion. The island's complex history—including its role as a detention camp for Seminole prisoners during the Third Seminole War—makes it one of Florida's most historically layered sites.
