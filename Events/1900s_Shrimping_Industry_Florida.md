# Florida Shrimping Industry: Pink Gold from the Gulf
## 1900s-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida shrimping industry has harvested "pink gold" from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic waters since the early 1900s, making Florida one of America's leading shrimp-producing states. Centered in ports like Key West, Tampa, Fort Myers Beach, and Fernandina Beach, the industry has employed thousands of fishermen, dock workers, and processors while providing fresh Gulf shrimp to tables across America. Though facing challenges from imported shrimp and environmental pressures, Florida's shrimping fleet remains an important part of the state's fishing heritage and coastal economy.
