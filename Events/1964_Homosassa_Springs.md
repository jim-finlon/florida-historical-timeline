# Homosassa Springs: Where the Manatees Come Home
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

Homosassa Springs, located on Florida's Nature Coast, pumps 65 million gallons of crystal-clear 72-degree water daily—perfect conditions for the endangered Florida manatees that have made it their winter refuge for thousands of years. Once a commercial attraction featuring everything from alligator wrestling to trained seals, Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park now focuses on wildlife rehabilitation and manatee observation, housing the world-famous Lu—a hippopotamus who has lived at the springs since 1964 and was made an honorary Florida citizen to remain after the state acquired the park. Today, visitors can observe manatees, native wildlife, and Lu through an underwater observatory that provides a unique window into this remarkable spring ecosystem.
