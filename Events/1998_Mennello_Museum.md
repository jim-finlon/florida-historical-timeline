## 1998-Present

---

## Overview

The Mennello Museum of American Art in Orlando, opened in 1998, showcases American folk art with a special focus on the works of self-taught artist Earl Cunningham. Located on the shores of Lake Formosa in Loch Haven Park, the intimate museum houses the world's largest collection of Cunningham's vibrant, dreamlike Florida landscapes alongside rotating exhibitions of American folk and outsider art. The museum began with the personal collection of Michael and Marilyn Mennello, who donated their beloved Cunningham paintings to create a public institution celebrating the unique vision of self-taught American artists.
