# The 1972 Miami Dolphins: The Perfect Season
## 17-0

---

## Overview

The 1972 Miami Dolphins remain the only team in NFL history to complete a perfect season, going 17-0 including playoffs and winning Super Bowl VII. Coach Don Shula's team combined a devastating running game featuring Larry Csonka and Mercury Morris, the "No-Name Defense," and clutch performances throughout to accomplish what no team before or since has managed. The Dolphins' perfection came just one year after losing the Super Bowl, making the achievement even more remarkable. Every year when the last undefeated team loses, the surviving members of the '72 Dolphins gather to toast their enduring distinction.
