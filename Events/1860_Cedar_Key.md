# Cedar Key: Florida's Forgotten First Boom Town
## 1860-Present

---

## Overview

Before Miami existed, before Palm Beach was imagined, Cedar Key was Florida's most important Gulf Coast town—the terminus of Florida's first cross-state railroad, a major shipping port, and the center of America's pencil industry. In the 1880s, Cedar Key was booming: factories, hotels, tourists, and trade made it one of Florida's most promising cities. Then the railroad moved south, the cedar trees ran out, and hurricanes pounded the town into near-oblivion. Today, this tiny fishing village on Florida's Nature Coast is a time capsule of old Florida, its Victorian buildings and working waterfront preserving memories of grander days.
