# Vizcaya: James Deering's Italian Palace on Biscayne Bay
## 1916-Present

---

## Overview

Rising from the shores of Biscayne Bay like a Renaissance dream, Vizcaya is one of America's greatest architectural treasures and a monument to the Gilded Age's unbridled ambition. Built between 1914 and 1922 for International Harvester heir James Deering, the 34-room Italian Renaissance-style villa and its magnificent formal gardens required 1,000 workers—ten percent of Miami's entire population at the time. Deering filled his winter palace with European antiques spanning 2,000 years, creating an instant heritage for a city that barely existed. Today, Vizcaya is Miami-Dade County's most visited museum and has hosted presidents, popes, and royalty, standing as proof that even in the Florida wilderness, anything could be built if you had enough money and vision.
