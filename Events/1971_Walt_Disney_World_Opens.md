# Walt Disney World Opens
## October 1, 1971

---

## Overview

On October 1, 1971, Walt Disney World opened its gates in Central Florida, transforming a swamp into a magical kingdom and forever changing the state's economy, landscape, and identity. The largest private construction project in the world at the time, Disney World brought to life Walt Disney's vision of a "Vacation Kingdom"—a destination far more ambitious than his California Disneyland. Though Walt himself died before seeing his dream realized, his brother Roy ensured the project's completion. Within a decade, Disney World had made Orlando one of the world's most visited tourist destinations and established tourism as Florida's dominant industry.

## The Setting

### Walt Disney's Vision

Walt Disney wanted more than another theme park:

**Disneyland's Limitations:**
- Opened 1955 in Anaheim, California
- Successful but constrained
- Surrounded by motels, shops, restaurants Disney didn't control
- Couldn't create the complete experience he envisioned

**The Florida Project:**
- Enough land to control the entire environment
- Hotels, attractions, transportation all integrated
- A complete "world" separated from ordinary reality
- Room to grow and experiment

### Secret Land Purchases

Disney's team bought land without revealing the buyer:

**1964-1965:**
- Agents quietly purchased land in Central Florida
- Used dummy corporations with names like "Bay Lake Properties"
- Sellers didn't know they were dealing with Disney
- Prices stayed low

**The Reveal:**
- October 1965: Word leaked that Disney was the buyer
- Land prices immediately skyrocketed
- But Disney already controlled approximately 27,000 acres (43 square miles)
- Twice the size of Manhattan

### The Site

**Central Florida:**
- About 20 miles southwest of Orlando
- Swamps, wetlands, citrus groves
- Sparse population
- Year-round warm weather
- Accessible by highway and (eventually) airport

## Walt Disney's Death

Tragedy struck before the dream was realized:

**December 15, 1966:**
- Walt Disney died of lung cancer
- Age 65
- Had been deeply involved in planning
- Would never see his creation open

**Roy O. Disney:**
- Walt's older brother
- Had previously managed business side
- Came out of retirement to complete the project
- Insisted it be named "Walt Disney World" not just "Disney World"
