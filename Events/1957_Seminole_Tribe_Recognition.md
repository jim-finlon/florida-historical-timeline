# The Seminole Tribe of Florida: Survival and Sovereignty
## The Unconquered People

---

## Overview

The Seminole Tribe of Florida stands unique in American history: they never signed a peace treaty with the United States, never surrendered, and never moved to Oklahoma. Descendants of those who evaded removal during the Seminole Wars (1817-1858), they survived for nearly a century in the Everglades, largely outside American society. In 1957, the Seminole Tribe of Florida was officially recognized by the federal government, beginning a new chapter of tribal sovereignty. In 1979, they opened the first Native American gaming operation in the country, eventually building a casino empire that made them one of the wealthiest tribes in America. Today, the Seminoles own the Hard Rock International brand and maintain their identity as the "Unconquered."
