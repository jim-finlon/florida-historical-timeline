# Virgil Hawkins and the Desegregation of Florida's Universities
## 1949-1976

---

## Overview

In 1949, Virgil Darnell Hawkins, a 42-year-old Black man from Okahumpka, Florida, applied to the University of Florida Law School and was denied admission because of his race. He would spend the next 27 years fighting for justice—not for himself, since he was eventually too old to attend, but for those who came after him. Hawkins's case went to the U.S. Supreme Court four times, and his persistence helped break down segregation in Florida's public universities. Though the state fought him for decades, other Black students were finally admitted while his own case dragged on. Hawkins eventually earned his law degree elsewhere and practiced briefly before his death, but his real legacy was opening the doors he was never allowed to walk through himself.
