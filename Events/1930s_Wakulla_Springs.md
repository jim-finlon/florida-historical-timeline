# Wakulla Springs: The Deepest and Purest
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

Wakulla Springs in North Florida is one of the largest and deepest freshwater springs in the world—a place where prehistoric mastodon bones lie 300 feet below crystal-clear water, where Creature from the Black Lagoon was filmed in the 1950s, and where Edward Ball built a hunting lodge that became one of Florida's most atmospheric state parks. The spring pumps up to 1.2 billion gallons per day from an underwater cave system that extends for miles, making it one of the most significant aquifer windows in the world. Manatees, alligators, and exotic birds share the river with glass-bottom boat tourists, creating an experience that feels unchanged from old Florida.
