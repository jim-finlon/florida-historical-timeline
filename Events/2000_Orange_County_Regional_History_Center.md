## Overview

The Orange County Regional History Center, opened in 2000 in downtown Orlando's beautifully restored 1927 courthouse, tells the story of Central Florida from prehistoric times through the theme park era and beyond. As a Smithsonian Affiliate, the museum presents the complex history of a region that transformed from frontier wilderness to citrus empire to international tourism capital in little more than a century.
