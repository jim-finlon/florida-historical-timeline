# Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum: Where the Writer Found Paradise
## 1964-Present

---

## Overview

The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum in Key West preserves the Spanish Colonial house where Nobel laureate Ernest Hemingway lived and wrote during the 1930s, one of the most productive periods of his career. Built in 1851 and purchased by Hemingway and his second wife Pauline in 1931, the property features the first swimming pool constructed in Key West, the writer's studio where he created some of his most famous works, and the descendants of his famous six-toed cats that still roam the grounds. The museum offers visitors an intimate look at the life and workspace of one of America's greatest writers during his Key West years.
