# Blue Spring: The Manatee Refuge
## 1972-Present

---

## Overview

Blue Spring, a first-magnitude spring on the St. Johns River near Orange City, has become one of the most important winter refuges for endangered Florida manatees. When water temperatures drop in the river, hundreds of manatees migrate to the spring's constant 72-degree waters, making Blue Spring State Park one of the best places in the world to observe these gentle giants. The park's manatee research program, begun in the 1970s, has tracked individual manatees for decades, and the population using the spring has grown from a handful to over 700 individuals—a conservation success story that continues to unfold each winter.
