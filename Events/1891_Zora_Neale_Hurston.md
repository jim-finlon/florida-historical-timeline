# Zora Neale Hurston: The Eatonville Genius
## 1891-1960

---

## Overview

Zora Neale Hurston was one of the most important American writers of the 20th century—an anthropologist, novelist, folklorist, and central figure of the Harlem Renaissance who grew up in Eatonville, Florida, the first incorporated Black town in America. Hurston's masterpiece, *Their Eyes Were Watching God* (1937), was set in Florida and drew on the Black Southern culture she grew up immersed in. Despite her literary achievements, Hurston died in poverty and obscurity in Fort Pierce, Florida, her grave unmarked until Alice Walker found and honored it in 1973. Today she is recognized as a towering figure in American letters, and her Eatonville home is a pilgrimage site for readers who love her work.
