## Overview

The Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, opened in 2017 in Miami's Museum Park, is a spectacular 250,000-square-foot science museum featuring a three-level aquarium, a planetarium, and interactive exhibits exploring the living world and the universe. Designed by Grimshaw Architects, the museum rises on the waterfront of Biscayne Bay adjacent to the Pérez Art Museum Miami, completing a world-class cultural campus in downtown Miami. The Frost's centerpiece—a 500,000-gallon Gulf Stream aquarium viewable from multiple levels—exemplifies the museum's mission to connect visitors with the science of Florida's unique environment and the broader natural world.
