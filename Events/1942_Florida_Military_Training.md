# Florida Becomes Military Training Center
## 1941-1945

---

## Overview

During World War II, Florida was transformed into one of the nation's most important military training grounds. The state's year-round warm weather, vast open spaces, long coastlines, and strategic location made it ideal for training pilots, sailors, and soldiers. By war's end, Florida hosted over 170 military installations, trained hundreds of thousands of service members, and permanently altered the state's economy and demographics. Cities like Jacksonville, Pensacola, Tampa, and Miami became military hubs, while even small towns hosted training camps, airfields, and naval stations. The war marked Florida's transition from a sleepy agricultural and tourism state to a modern, defense-oriented economy.
