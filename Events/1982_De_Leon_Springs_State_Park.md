# De Leon Springs State Park: The Fountain of Youth That Wasn't
## 1513-Present

---

## Overview

De Leon Springs State Park in Volusia County preserves a first-magnitude spring that has attracted humans for thousands of years—from Paleo-Indians who camped here 6,000 years ago to modern visitors who come to swim in its 72°F waters and make pancakes at the Old Spanish Sugar Mill restaurant built inside a 19th-century sugar mill. Legend claims Ponce de León himself sought the Fountain of Youth here in 1513, though historians doubt he ever visited this particular spring. Regardless, De Leon Springs offers visitors a chance to experience one of Florida's original tourist attractions: a natural spring that has refreshed, fed, and inspired people for millennia.
