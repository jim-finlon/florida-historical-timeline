# Florida Returns to Spain: The Second Spanish Period Begins
## 1783

---

## Overview

On September 3, 1783, the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War included a provision returning Florida to Spanish sovereignty. After just twenty years of British rule, Florida would spend another four decades under Spanish control—a period characterized by weak governance, American encroachment, free Black communities, adventurer invasions, and the growing presence of the Seminole people. This Second Spanish Period (1783-1821) would prove to be a twilight era, ending with Florida's transfer to the United States.

## The Setting

### Spain's Entry into the Revolutionary War

Spain's recovery of Florida came through opportunistic diplomacy:

**Alliance with France (1779):**
- Spain joined the American Revolution as an ally of France (not of the American rebels)
- Hoped to recover territory lost to Britain
- Particularly wanted Gibraltar, Minorca, and Florida

**Military Operations:**
- Bernardo de Gálvez led Spanish forces in the Gulf region
- Captured British posts along the Mississippi
- **1780:** Seized Mobile, Alabama
- **1781:** Captured Pensacola after a siege

**The Prize:**
- By war's end, Spain controlled West Florida militarily
- East Florida was ceded in the peace treaty
- Spain recovered all of Florida without paying Britain

### The Treaty of Paris (1783)

**Signed:** September 3, 1783

**Key Terms (Regarding Florida):**
- Britain ceded East and West Florida to Spain
- Boundaries between Spanish Florida and the new United States vaguely defined
- Set the stage for future territorial disputes

## The Transition

### British Departure

The British withdrawal was more complicated than the Spanish exodus of 1763:

**The Loyalists' Dilemma:**
- Thousands of Loyalists had fled to East Florida during the Revolution
- Now they faced life under Spanish rule or another move
- Many chose to leave for the Bahamas, Nova Scotia, or England
- But many also stayed

**Population in Transition:**
- Approximately 17,000 people in East Florida at end of British rule
- This included large enslaved population
- Many Loyalists left, taking enslaved people with them
- But significant English-speaking population remained

**Continuity:**
- Some British plantations continued operating
- English remained a major language
- Economic patterns established under British persisted

### Spanish Restoration

Spain reclaimed a very different Florida than it had left:

**What Changed:**
- Plantation agriculture now dominated the economy
- Large enslaved population present
- English-speaking majority
- Mission system long dead
- Native population transformed (Seminoles replacing earlier tribes)

**Spanish Challenges:**
- Few Spanish colonists available to settle Florida
- Limited resources for development
- Weak administrative capacity
- United States now a powerful neighbor

## The Second Spanish Period (1783-1821)

### Governance

Spanish administration struggled throughout:

**Governors:**
- Appointed from Spain or other colonies
- Often capable but under-resourced
- Struggled with limited budgets and few troops

**Notable Governors:**
- **Vicente Manuel de Céspedes** (1784-1790): First governor, established Spanish authority
- **Enrique White** (1796-1811): Longest-serving, dealt with multiple crises
- **Juan José de Estrada** (1811-1815): Faced American incursions

**The Situado:**
- Annual subsidy from Mexico
- Never adequate and often late
- Florida remained an economic drain on Spain

### Population Policies

Spain adopted pragmatic policies to populate Florida:

**Religious Tolerance:**
- Abandoned requirement that settlers be Catholic
- Allowed Protestants to settle (couldn't afford to exclude them)
- Practical necessity overcame religious principle

**Land Grants:**
- Generous grants to attract settlers
- Many went to Americans willing to swear loyalty to Spain
- Created mixed population with questionable loyalty

**The Result:**
- English-speaking population grew
- American influence increased
- Florida became increasingly Americanized

### Free Black Communities

The Second Spanish Period saw significant free Black communities:

**Spanish Racial Policies:**
- Spain did not view slavery as permanent
- Enslaved people could purchase their freedom
- Military service could earn freedom
- More pathways to liberty than under British/American rule

**Fort Mose Legacy:**
- Tradition of free Black settlements dated to First Spanish Period
- During Second Period, free Blacks lived in St. Augustine, Fernandina, Pensacola
- Some owned property and businesses

**Black Seminoles:**
- Escaped enslaved people found refuge in Florida
- Formed communities near and among Seminole villages
- Created independent settlements
- Drew fury from American slaveholders

## Conflicts and Crises

### The United States as Neighbor

The new American republic proved an aggressive neighbor:

**Boundary Disputes:**
- Treaty of Paris left boundaries vague
- Americans claimed territory Spain considered its own
- Eventually settled by Pinckney's Treaty (1795)

**American Ambition:**
- Many Americans saw Spanish Florida as future territory
- Weak Spanish control invited encroachment
- Frontier was fluid and violent

### Patriot War (1812-1814)

American "patriots" attempted to seize Florida:

**The Invasion:**
- American settlers and filibusters invaded East Florida
- Supported covertly by the U.S. government
- Declared a "Republic of Florida"
- Captured Fernandina and besieged St. Augustine

**Spanish Resistance:**
- Governor Sebastián Kindelán organized defense
- St. Augustine held out
- British assistance during War of 1812 helped Spain

**The Outcome:**
- Patriots eventually withdrew
- But demonstrated Spain's inability to control Florida
- Presaged eventual American takeover

### Negro Fort and the First Seminole War

The most explosive issue involved escaped enslaved people:

**Negro Fort (1816):**
- During War of 1812, British built fort on Apalachicola River
- After British departure, fort taken over by free Blacks and natives
- American slaveholders outraged by "fortress of runaway slaves"
- U.S. forces destroyed it, killing hundreds

**First Seminole War (1817-1818):**
- Andrew Jackson invaded Spanish Florida
- Ostensibly pursuing Seminoles and escaped slaves
- Captured Spanish posts, executed British traders
- Demonstrated Spain's inability to control territory

## The Seminole Emergence

### Who Were the Seminoles?

The Second Spanish Period saw the crystallization of Seminole identity:

**Origins:**
- Not a single tribe but a confederation
- Creek emigrants who moved into Florida
- Remnants of earlier Florida tribes
- Escaped enslaved Africans (Black Seminoles)

**Development:**
- Filled vacuum left by decimated original Florida tribes
- Established villages throughout North Florida
- Developed distinct culture, language, and identity
- Increasingly seen as obstacle to American expansion

### Seminole-Spanish Relations

Relations were complex:

**Generally Peaceful:**
- Seminoles preferred Spanish rule to American
- Spanish lacked power to dominate them
- Both parties benefited from trade
- Spain saw Seminoles as buffer against Americans

**Points of Tension:**
- Spanish couldn't control Seminole raids on American territory
- Americans blamed Spain for harboring "hostiles"
- Escaped slaves among Seminoles enraged Americans
- Spain couldn't satisfy either side

## The Path to Transfer

### Spain's Decline

By the 1810s, Spain was losing grip on its American empire:

**Napoleonic Wars:**
- Napoleon invaded Spain (1808)
- Spanish monarchy collapsed temporarily
- Colonial administration disrupted
- Resources diverted to European struggle

**Latin American Independence:**
- Mexico, Peru, Colombia fighting for independence
- Spain couldn't focus on peripheral Florida
- Limited military resources

**Exhaustion:**
- Florida was expensive liability
- No strategic value without control
- American pressure unrelenting

### Adams-Onís Treaty (1819)

Spain finally agreed to sell:

**Negotiations:**
- John Quincy Adams (U.S. Secretary of State)
- Luis de Onís (Spanish minister)
- Years of difficult negotiation

**Terms:**
- Spain ceded Florida to the United States
- U.S. assumed $5 million in claims by American citizens against Spain
- Spain received no direct payment
- U.S. renounced claims to Texas

**Signing:** February 22, 1819
**Ratification:** Delayed until 1821

The Second Spanish Period ended, and American Florida began.
