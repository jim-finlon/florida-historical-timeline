# Mission San Luis: The Apalachee Capital
## 1656-1704

---

## Overview

Mission San Luis de Talimali, located on a hilltop in present-day Tallahassee, was the western capital of Spanish Florida's mission system and the political center of the Apalachee nation. From 1656 until its destruction in 1704, this remarkable settlement was home to over 1,400 Apalachee Indians and Spanish colonists living side by side—a unique experiment in cultural coexistence. Today, Mission San Luis is a living history museum where reconstructed buildings—including a massive Apalachee council house and a Spanish church—allow visitors to experience life in colonial Florida. It is one of the most significant Spanish colonial sites in the United States.
