# The Biltmore Hotel: Coral Gables' Crown Jewel
## 1926-Present

---

## Overview

When George Merrick opened the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables in January 1926, he unveiled what many consider the most beautiful hotel ever built in Florida—a Mediterranean Revival masterpiece crowned by a 315-foot tower modeled after the Giralda in Seville, Spain. The Biltmore was the crown jewel of Merrick's planned city of Coral Gables, designed to attract the wealthy and cultured to his vision of a "City Beautiful." Within months of opening, the 1926 hurricane devastated Miami and the land boom collapsed, but the Biltmore endured through the Depression, served as a military hospital in World War II, sat vacant for decades, and finally reopened in 1987 as a luxury resort. Today it remains Coral Gables' iconic landmark and one of America's most celebrated historic hotels.
