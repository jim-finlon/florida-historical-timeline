# Bok Tower Gardens: A Singing Tower in the Orange Groves
## 1929-Present

---

## Overview

In 1929, Dutch-American publisher Edward Bok dedicated one of America's most unusual monuments: a 205-foot Gothic-style carillon tower rising from the highest point in peninsular Florida, surrounded by magnificent gardens. Bok, who had made his fortune as editor of the Ladies' Home Journal, wanted to create a place of beauty and tranquility to repay America for the opportunities it had given an immigrant boy. He hired Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to design the gardens and Milton Medary to design the tower, which houses a 60-bell carillon that still plays daily concerts across the hills of Lake Wales. Bok Tower remains one of Florida's most beloved and least expected treasures.
