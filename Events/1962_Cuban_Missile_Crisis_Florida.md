# The Cuban Missile Crisis: Florida on the Front Line
## October 16-28, 1962

---

## Overview

In October 1962, Florida became the front line of a potential nuclear war. When American reconnaissance discovered Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from Key West, Florida transformed into an armed camp. Military bases throughout the state went to maximum readiness, thousands of troops poured into South Florida, and residents faced the terrifying possibility of atomic annihilation. For thirteen days, the world held its breath while President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Khrushchev negotiated. Florida's unique geographic position—closer to Cuba than any other American territory—made the crisis intensely personal for its residents, who could look south and imagine the missiles pointed at them.
