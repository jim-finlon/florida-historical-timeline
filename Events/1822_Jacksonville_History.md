# Jacksonville: The Bold New City of the South
## 1822-Present

---

## Overview

Jacksonville, sprawling across 875 square miles as the largest city by area in the contiguous United States, has risen from a small St. Johns River crossing to become Florida's most populous city and a major economic hub of the Southeast. Named for Andrew Jackson in 1822, Jacksonville has survived devastating fires, reinvented itself multiple times, and consolidated with Duval County in 1968 to create a bold new city. From its brief era as "the Hollywood of the East" to its role as a major port, insurance center, and military hub, Jacksonville's story reflects Florida's transformation from frontier territory to modern Sunbelt powerhouse.
