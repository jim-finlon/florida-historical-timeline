# Rainbow Springs: The Painted Waters
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

Rainbow Springs, located near Dunnellon in Marion County, is Florida's fourth-largest spring, pumping 400-600 million gallons of crystal-clear water daily. The springs get their name from the rainbow of colors that seem to dance across the bottom—a play of light through the clear water illuminating the rainbow-colored aquatic plants and limestone. Once a major tourist attraction rivaling Silver Springs, Rainbow Springs fell into decline after theme parks rose. Today, Rainbow Springs State Park protects this natural wonder, offering swimming, tubing, and a chance to experience one of Florida's most beautiful springs in a natural setting.
