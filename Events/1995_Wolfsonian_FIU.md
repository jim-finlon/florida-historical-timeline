# The Wolfsonian-FIU: Design and Propaganda in the Modern Age
## 1995-Present

---

## Overview

The Wolfsonian-FIU, a museum, library, and research center affiliated with Florida International University, houses one of the world's most significant collections of decorative and propaganda arts from the period 1885-1945—the critical decades when industrialization and mass communication transformed society. Founded by collector Mitchell Wolfson Jr. and opened in 1995 in a renovated 1927 Art Deco storage facility on Miami Beach's Washington Avenue, the Wolfsonian explores how design shapes and reflects the human experience, with particular focus on the political, social, and aesthetic movements that defined the modern world.
