# George Merrick and the Creation of Coral Gables
## 1921-1926

---

## Overview

In the early 1920s, George Edgar Merrick transformed his family's citrus grove southwest of Miami into America's first fully planned community: Coral Gables. Unlike the chaotic speculation of the Florida land boom happening around him, Merrick envisioned a Mediterranean paradise with winding streets, plazas, ornamental gateways, and strict architectural standards. He hired artists and architects, created the legendary Biltmore Hotel, and marketed his creation with poetry and pageantry. When the 1926 hurricane and land bust destroyed his fortune, Merrick lost everything but left behind a city that remains one of America's most beautiful planned communities—a living monument to one man's aesthetic vision.
