# The Cuban Revolution's Impact on Florida: Castro Transforms the Sunshine State
## 1959-Present

---

## Overview

The Cuban Revolution of 1959, which brought Fidel Castro to power just 90 miles from Key West, fundamentally transformed Florida—particularly South Florida—in ways that continue to shape the state today. The exodus of Cubans fleeing communism created the largest and most politically influential Hispanic community in the United States, turning Miami into a Latin American capital and gateway to the hemisphere. The revolution's aftermath brought the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, multiple migration waves, and decades of anti-Castro politics that made Florida a crucial battleground state in national elections.
