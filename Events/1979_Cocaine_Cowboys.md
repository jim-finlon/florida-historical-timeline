# The Cocaine Cowboys Era: Miami's Drug War
## 1979-1989

---

## Overview

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Miami became the cocaine capital of the United States, and the violence that accompanied the drug trade transformed the city into a war zone. Colombian drug cartels used South Florida as their primary gateway to the American market, and the struggle for control brought shootouts in shopping malls, assassinations in broad daylight, and a murder rate that made Miami the deadliest city in America. At the same time, billions of drug dollars flooded into the local economy, fueling a construction boom and creating a surreal juxtaposition of wealth and carnage. The "Cocaine Cowboys" era permanently changed Miami's image, culture, and development.
