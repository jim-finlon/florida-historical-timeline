# Building Flagler's Folly: The Workers of the Overseas Railroad
## 1905-1912

---

## Overview

The construction of Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad to Key West—derided as "Flagler's Folly"—was one of the greatest engineering achievements in American history, but it came at a terrible human cost. Between 1905 and 1912, thousands of workers labored in brutal conditions to build 156 miles of railroad across open ocean, mangrove swamps, and coral islands. They faced hurricanes, disease, isolation, and dangerous work, earning wages that often disappeared into company stores. The 1906 and 1909 hurricanes killed hundreds of workers. When the railroad was finally completed, most of those who built it had vanished into history, their sacrifices unmarked while Flagler was celebrated. Their story is a darker chapter of Florida's Gilded Age.
