# Florida Naval Stores Industry: Turpentine and Tar from the Pines
## 1800s-1950s

---

## Overview

The naval stores industry—the production of turpentine, rosin, and tar from pine trees—was once one of Florida's largest industries, employing thousands of workers across the state's vast pine forests. From the mid-1800s through the mid-1900s, Florida led the nation in turpentine production, with the slash pines of North and Central Florida providing raw materials essential for shipbuilding, paint, medicine, and industrial applications. The industry left an indelible mark on Florida's landscape, economy, and culture, though its legacy includes the brutal exploitation of convict and debt-bonded labor that tarnished this chapter of state history.
