# The Selection of Tallahassee as Florida's Capital
## 1824

---

## Overview

When the United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821, the new territory faced an immediate practical problem: its two main settlements, St. Augustine and Pensacola, were 400 miles apart with nothing but wilderness, hostile Indians, and swamps between them. Legislative council meetings alternated between the two cities, requiring delegates to make dangerous weeks-long journeys that some did not survive. In 1824, the territorial government commissioned an expedition to find a midpoint for a new capital. The scouts recommended a site near an abandoned Apalachee Indian settlement, and thus Tallahassee—a Creek word meaning "old fields" or "old town"—became Florida's capital, a distinction it has held for two centuries despite being far removed from the state's modern population centers.
