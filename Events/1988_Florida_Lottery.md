## 1988-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida Lottery, launched in 1988 after voter approval of a constitutional amendment, has become one of the largest and most profitable state lotteries in the United States, generating over $40 billion for education since its inception. From scratch-off tickets sold at convenience stores to multi-state jackpots worth hundreds of millions, the lottery has fundamentally changed Florida's gambling landscape while providing crucial funding for educational programs including Bright Futures scholarships. The lottery's success also transformed Florida's gaming industry, paving the way for later gambling expansion while dramatically impacting traditional pari-mutuel operations.
