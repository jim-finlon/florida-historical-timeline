# Florida Secedes from the Union
## January 10, 1861

---

## Overview

On January 10, 1861, Florida became the third state to secede from the United States, following South Carolina and Mississippi. Meeting in convention at Tallahassee, delegates voted 62 to 7 to dissolve Florida's ties to the Union and join the nascent Confederate States of America. Though Florida was the least populous and least developed of the Confederate states, its strategic coastline, cattle herds, and salt production would make it important to the Southern war effort. The decision for secession, made just sixteen years after statehood, would plunge Florida into four years of war and a decade of Reconstruction.

## The Setting

### The Election of 1860

The immediate cause of secession was Abraham Lincoln's election:

**The Campaign:**
- Four candidates split the national vote
- Abraham Lincoln (Republican) won with only 40% of the popular vote
- Lincoln's name did not even appear on Florida's ballot
- Southern states perceived his election as a threat to slavery

**Florida's Vote:**
- John C. Breckinridge (Southern Democrat): 8,277 votes
- John Bell (Constitutional Union): 5,437 votes
- Stephen Douglas (Northern Democrat): 223 votes
- Lincoln (Republican): 0 votes
- No Republican Party organization existed in Florida

### Florida's Slave Society

By 1860, Florida was thoroughly a slave state:

**Population:**
- Total population: approximately 140,000
- Enslaved people: approximately 61,000 (44%)
- In some counties, enslaved outnumbered free by 2:1

**Economy:**
- Cotton plantations in North Florida
- Some sugar production
- Ranching in interior
- All dependent on enslaved labor

**Politics:**
- Planter elite controlled state government
- Democratic Party dominated
- No organized opposition to slavery

## The Road to Secession

### South Carolina's Lead

**December 20, 1860:**
- South Carolina became first state to secede
- Florida's governor called for similar action
- Other Deep South states followed

### Florida's Convention

**Governor Madison Starke Perry:**
- Called special legislative session
- Legislature authorized secession convention
- Elections held for delegates

**The Convention:**
- Met January 3, 1861, in Tallahassee
- 69 delegates (later reduced to 68)
- Mostly planters and professionals
- Overwhelmingly pro-secession

### The Debate

Some opposed immediate secession:

**Cooperationists:**
- Preferred waiting for joint Southern action
- Wanted to negotiate with Lincoln first
- Not opposed to secession in principle—just timing

**Secessionists:**
- Demanded immediate departure
- Saw delay as dangerous
- Lincoln would use time against the South

## The Story

### The Vote

On January 10, 1861, after days of debate, the convention voted:

**The Tally:**
- For secession: 62
- Against secession: 7

**The Moment:**
When the vote was announced, delegates erupted in cheers. Cannon were fired. Church bells rang across Tallahassee. Florida had left the Union.

**The Ordinance:**
The formal document declared that:
> "We, the people of the State of Florida in Convention assembled, do solemnly ordain, publish and declare: That the State of Florida hereby withdraws herself from the Confederacy of States existing under the name of the United States of America, and from the existing Government of said States..."

### Who Voted No?

Seven delegates voted against secession:

**The Dissenters:**
- George T. Ward (Leon County) - ironically from the plantation heartland
- J.B. Owens (Marion County)
- C.E. Dyke (Leon County)
- And four others

**Their Reasoning:**
- Not pro-Union necessarily

- Feared Florida acting alone
- But once the vote passed, most joined the Confederate cause

- Representatives from seceded states met in Montgomery, Alabama
- Formed the Confederate States of America
- Florida was a founding member

**Florida's Representatives:**

## Florida in the Confederacy

### The Reality of War

Florida's role was shaped by its geography:

**Advantages:**
- Long coastline (difficult to blockade completely)
- Cattle herds (beef for Confederate armies)
- Salt production (essential for preserving food)
- Distant from major fighting (initially)

**Disadvantages:**
- Small population (limited manpower)
- Underdeveloped economy
- Poor transportation
- Vulnerable coastline

### Military Contribution

**Florida Troops:**
- Approximately 15,000 Floridians served in Confederate armies
- Fought in major campaigns in Virginia, Tennessee, and elsewhere
- Many died far from home

**Significant Units:**
- 2nd Florida Infantry
- 5th Florida Infantry
- 1st Florida Cavalry

### The Home Front

**Challenges:**
- Union naval blockade cut off trade
- Union forces seized coastal areas
- Food shortages in later years
- Many men gone to war

**Contributions:**
- Beef: Florida cattle fed Confederate armies
- Salt: Florida salt works were crucial
- Cotton: Attempted blockade running

Florida's early secession was significant:

**Timeline of Secession:**
| State | Date |
|-------|------|

### A Fateful Decision

Secession led to:

- Four years of war
- Thousands of Florida deaths
- Economic devastation
- Emancipation of enslaved people
- Reconstruction (1865-1877)
- Lasting changes to Florida society

### Why Florida Seceded

The causes were clear:

1. **Slavery:** The primary motivation—protection of the slave system
2. **Political:** Republicans threatened Southern interests
3. **Economic:** Plantation economy required enslaved labor
4. **Cultural:** Identification with the South and its "way of life"
5. **Fear:** Concerns about abolition and its consequences

## What Might Have Been

The seven dissenters raise questions:

**If Florida Had Waited:**
- Would other states have followed?
- Could compromise have been reached?
- Was secession inevitable?

**Historical Consensus:**
- Secession was the overwhelming will of Florida's voters (or at least the white male voters who could vote)
- The planter elite controlled the process
- Opposition was minimal and quickly overcome
