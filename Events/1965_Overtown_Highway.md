# The Destruction of Overtown: When the Highway Came Through
## 1965-1970

---

## Overview

In the 1960s, Miami's vibrant Black community of Overtown was destroyed by the construction of Interstate 95 and Interstate 395, which tore directly through its heart. What had been the cultural and commercial center of Black Miami—home to hotels, nightclubs, theaters, and a thriving business district where legends like Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, and Muhammad Ali stayed and performed—was reduced to rubble. Twenty thousand residents were displaced, businesses were demolished, and a community that had flourished for decades was deliberately destroyed. The highway routes were chosen specifically to run through Black neighborhoods while avoiding white ones. Overtown never recovered, and its destruction stands as one of the starkest examples of how urban highway construction devastated Black America.

## The Highway Decision

### The Planning

**Interstate System:**
- Federal Highway Act of 1956
- Massive national highway construction
- Cities chose routes
- Miami made its choices

**The Route Selection:**
- I-95: North-South
- I-395: East-West
- Both routed through Overtown
- Not through white neighborhoods

### The Racism

**The Pattern:**
- Nationwide, highways built through Black neighborhoods
- "Slum clearance" as justification
- White neighborhoods avoided
- Deliberate destruction

**Miami's Choice:**
- Alternative routes existed
- White neighborhoods protected
- Black community expendable
- Political power imbalance

### The Justification

**The Arguments:**
- "Blight removal"
- "Urban renewal"
- "Progress"
- "Necessary sacrifice"

**The Reality:**
- Thriving community labeled as slum
- Residents had no political power
- Opposition ignored
