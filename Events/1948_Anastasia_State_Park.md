# Anastasia State Park: St. Augustine's Island Beach
## 1948-Present

---

## Overview

Anastasia State Park protects 1,600 acres of barrier island habitat directly across the Matanzas River from historic St. Augustine, offering visitors a pristine Atlantic beach, tidal salt marsh, and maritime hammock forest within sight of the nation's oldest city. Established in 1948, the park preserves a landscape that has witnessed the entire sweep of Florida's European history—from the Spanish colonizers who quarried coquina stone here for the Castillo de San Marcos to the modern beachgoers who flock to its four miles of uncrowded shoreline. The park's ancient coquina quarries, excellent surfing waves, and abundant wildlife make it one of Florida's most popular and historically significant state parks.
