# The Lightner Museum: Gilded Age Treasures in Flagler's Alcazar
## 1888/1948-Present

---

## Overview

The Lightner Museum in St. Augustine occupies one of Henry Flagler's grandest creations—the Alcazar Hotel, built in 1888 as a companion to his legendary Ponce de León Hotel. When Chicago publisher Otto C. Lightner purchased the abandoned building in 1948, he filled it with his extraordinary collection of Gilded Age decorative arts, Victorian curiosities, and American antiques. Today, the museum displays everything from Tiffany glass to mechanical musical instruments, from Victorian cut glass to natural science specimens, all within the soaring spaces of Flagler's Spanish Renaissance masterpiece. The Lightner stands as both a monument to Florida's Gilded Age tourism and a cabinet of wonders celebrating 19th-century craftsmanship.
