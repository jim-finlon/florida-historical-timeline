# Florida Becomes a United States Territory
## July 1821

---

## Overview

On July 10, 1821, in a ceremony at the Plaza de la Constitución in St. Augustine, Spanish Governor José Coppinger formally surrendered East Florida to Andrew Jackson, the newly appointed American governor. One week later, Pensacola witnessed a similar transfer of West Florida. After 256 years of Spanish rule (with a 20-year British interlude), Florida became American territory. Yet the new territory would face 24 years of challenges—including Seminole wars, debates over slavery, and sparse population—before finally achieving statehood in 1845.

## The Setting

### The Adams-Onís Treaty Fulfilled

The treaty signed in 1819 had finally been ratified:

**Timeline:**
- February 22, 1819: Treaty signed
- Spanish ratification delayed until October 24, 1820
- American re-ratification: February 19, 1821
- Implementation: July 1821

**Andrew Jackson's Appointment:**
- Named first governor of Florida by President Monroe
- Already famous for his 1818 invasion
- Controversial choice—had forcibly seized Spanish posts
- Brought his characteristic aggression to the role

### What America Acquired

**The Territory:**
- Approximately 65,000 square miles
- Modern Florida plus strips of modern Alabama and Mississippi
- Two disconnected settled areas (St. Augustine, Pensacola)
- Vast, unexplored interior

**The Population:**
- Approximately 8,000 non-native inhabitants
- Seminoles (perhaps 5,000-6,000)
- Escaped slaves and free Blacks in Seminole communities
- Very sparse for such a large territory

## The Transfer

### St. Augustine Ceremony (July 10, 1821)

**The Scene:**
- The Plaza de la Constitución, heart of the old Spanish city
- Spanish troops assembled for the last time
- American troops waiting to take their place
- Townspeople watching history unfold

**The Ceremony:**
- Spanish Governor José Coppinger surrendered the province
- Spanish flag lowered from the Castillo
- American flag raised in its place
- Documents signed transferring authority

**Jackson's Arrival:**
- The general had sailed from New Orleans
- Entered St. Augustine as conquering hero
- Took up residence in the former Spanish governor's quarters
- Immediately began asserting American authority

### Pensacola Ceremony (July 17, 1821)

**The Transfer:**
- West Florida surrendered one week later
- Spanish Colonel José Callava handed over authority

## Organizing the Territory

### Initial Government

**Temporary Military Rule:**
- Jackson served as governor for only a few months
- Left Florida in October 1821, frustrated by the challenges
- Returned to Tennessee

**The Organic Act (March 30, 1822):**
- Congress established the Territory of Florida
- Merged East and West Florida into single territory
- Provided for appointed governor and territorial legislature

**First Territorial Governor:**
- William Pope DuVal (served 1822-1834)
- First permanent civilian governor
- Kentucky politician and frontiersman
- Would serve longer than any other territorial governor

### Establishing a Capital

**The Problem:**
- St. Augustine (East Florida's capital) was too far east
- Pensacola (West Florida's capital) was too far west
- Communication between them was difficult
- A central location was needed

**The Solution: Tallahassee:**
- 1824: Site selected for new capital
- Midway between St. Augustine and Pensacola
- Near former Apalachee territory
- Named from Muskogee word meaning "old town" or "abandoned fields"

**Building the Capital:**
- First legislative session met in log structures
- Permanent buildings gradually constructed
- Became seat of territorial (later state) government
- Remains Florida's capital today

## The Story

### Jackson's Brief Tenure

Andrew Jackson's few months as governor set the tone for American Florida:

**His Approach:**
- Imperious, demanding, quick to anger
- Saw Spanish officials as obstacles
- Tolerated no delays or opposition
- More military commander than civil administrator

**Conflicts:**
- Quarreled with Spanish officials over the transfer
- Arrested Colonel Callava in document dispute
- Alienated many he was supposed to work with
- Created diplomatic protests from Spain

**Departure:**
- Left Florida in October 1821
- Claimed health reasons (malaria)
- Never returned as governor
- Would return to Florida for the First Seminole War's aftermath

### The Early Territorial Years

Florida's territorial period was characterized by:

**Slow Settlement:**
- Initial population under 10,000 (non-native)
- Grew slowly through the 1820s
- Land grants and promotional efforts attracted some settlers
- But Florida remained sparsely populated

**Economic Development:**
- Plantation agriculture spread into North Florida
- Cotton and sugar became major crops
- Enslaved population grew rapidly
- Subsistence farming elsewhere

**Native Relations:**
- Seminoles pushed into treaties
- Confined to reservations in Central Florida
- Tensions over escaped slaves continued
- Set stage for Second Seminole War

## Challenges of the Territorial Period

### The Slavery Issue

Slavery shaped territorial Florida:

**Expansion:**
- Plantation agriculture meant slave agriculture
- Enslaved population grew from hundreds to tens of thousands
- Cotton and sugar plantations spread across North Florida

**The Escaped Slave Issue:**
- Black Seminole communities remained
- American slaveholders demanded return of "property"
- Tensions with Seminoles partly about escaped slaves

**Congressional Debates:**
- Would Florida enter as slave or free state?
- Tied to debates over Missouri, Texas, and sectional balance
- Florida's admission delayed by these politics

### The Seminole Question

The Seminoles were the territory's largest problem:

**Treaty of Moultrie Creek (1823):**
- Seminoles agreed to move to reservation in Central Florida
- Supposed to give up claims to North Florida
- Many Seminoles refused to comply

**Escalating Tension:**
- Americans wanted all Seminoles removed to Oklahoma
- Seminoles resisted leaving Florida
- Clashes over escaped slaves continued
- Violence erupted periodically

**Second Seminole War (1835-1842):**
- Largest and most expensive Indian war in U.S. history
- Consumed the territory for seven years
- Thousands dead on all sides
- Eventually most Seminoles removed, but never fully defeated

### Sparse Population

Florida struggled to attract settlers:

**Reasons:**
- Climate (hot, humid, disease-ridden)
- Seminole threat
- Distance from other population centers
- Reputation for danger and difficulty

**Growth:**
- 1830 census: approximately 34,730 total
- 1840 census: approximately 54,477 total
- Still very sparse for 65,000 square miles

## Path to Statehood

### Why Statehood Was Delayed

Florida's admission took 24 years (1821-1845):

**Congressional Politics:**
- Slavery debate made admitting new states contentious
- Florida would be a slave state
- Balance between free and slave states at stake

**Population Requirements:**
- Territories needed sufficient population
- Florida grew slowly
- Only achieved threshold by mid-1840s

**The Iowa Solution:**
- Florida's admission paired with Iowa (free state)
- Maintained sectional balance
- Both admitted in 1845

### Statehood Achieved

**March 3, 1845:**
- Florida became the 27th state
- Last Atlantic seaboard state admitted
- Slave state, part of the South
- Capital remained at Tallahassee

## Significance

### End of Colonial Era

The 1821 transfer marked the final colonial transition:

| Regime | Period | Years |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Spanish | 1565-1763 | 198 |
| British | 1763-1783 | 20 |
| Spanish | 1783-1821 | 38 |
| American | 1821-present | Ongoing |

**Total European Colonial Rule:** 256 years

### Beginning of American Florida

American rule brought:

1. **English dominance:** Spanish influence faded
2. **Plantation slavery:** Expanded dramatically
3. **Native removal:** The Seminole Wars
4. **Development:** Slow but persistent growth
5. **Statehood:** Political integration with the United States

### Continuity and Change

Some things persisted across the transition:

- St. Augustine remained a cultural center
- Spanish land grants created ongoing legal issues
- The Castillo still dominated St. Augustine's waterfront
- But American culture, law, and institutions replaced Spanish ones
