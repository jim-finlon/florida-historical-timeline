# Paynes Prairie: Florida's American Serengeti
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

Paynes Prairie is a 21,000-acre basin south of Gainesville that has been called Florida's Serengeti—a vast wet prairie where herds of wild horses and bison roam beneath circling sandhill cranes, just as they did when William Bartram visited in 1774 and called it "the great Alachua Savanna." For over 12,000 years, humans have lived along its edges, drawn by the abundant wildlife. The prairie has been lake and grassland alternately, shaped by sinkholes that periodically drain it. Today, Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park protects one of Florida's most significant natural and historical landscapes.
