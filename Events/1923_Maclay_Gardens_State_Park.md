# Alfred B. Maclay Gardens State Park: Tallahassee's Floral Crown
## 1923-Present

---

## Overview

Alfred B. Maclay Gardens State Park preserves one of the South's finest ornamental gardens—a 28-acre horticultural masterpiece created by New York financier Alfred B. Maclay and his wife Louise beginning in 1923. Set on the shores of Lake Hall in Tallahassee, the gardens showcase hundreds of camellias and azaleas that burst into spectacular bloom each winter and spring, transforming the landscape into a tapestry of pink, red, white, and purple. The Maclays spent decades collecting rare camellia cultivars and designing the garden's sweeping lawns, reflection pools, and secret gardens. After Maclay's death in 1944, his widow donated the property to the state, ensuring that this living work of art would delight visitors for generations.
