# Ybor City: Cigar Capital of the World
## 1886-Present

---

## Overview

In 1886, Spanish cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez Ybor moved his factory from Key West to a patch of scrubland east of Tampa, creating what would become the "Cigar Capital of the World." Within decades, Ybor City was a bustling immigrant community where Cubans, Spaniards, Italians, and others rolled cigars by hand while listening to "lectores" read novels and newspapers aloud. At its peak, Ybor City's factories produced 500 million cigars annually. Though mechanization and changing tastes eventually diminished the industry, today's Ybor City—now a National Historic Landmark District—preserves the brick factories, wrought-iron balconies, and Latin culture that made it America's most remarkable immigrant industrial community.
