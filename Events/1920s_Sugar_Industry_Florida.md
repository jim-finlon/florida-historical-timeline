# Florida Sugar Industry: The Everglades Empire
## 1920s-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida sugar industry, centered in the rich muck soils south of Lake Okeechobee, has grown from experimental beginnings in the 1920s into a $3 billion agricultural powerhouse that produces about half of America's domestically grown cane sugar. The industry's rise came at tremendous environmental cost—the draining of the Everglades created the farmland but disrupted natural water flow to Florida Bay and the coastal ecosystems. Today, the sugar industry remains politically powerful and economically significant while facing ongoing debates about its environmental impact, federal subsidies, and relationship to Everglades restoration.
