# Spring Break: Fort Lauderdale and the College Invasion
## 1936-Present

---

## Overview

Spring Break as an American institution began in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1936 when a college swim coach brought his team south to train in the warm weather. By the 1950s, word had spread, and college students began descending on Fort Lauderdale every March and April. The phenomenon exploded after the 1960 film *Where the Boys Are*, which portrayed Fort Lauderdale as a paradise of sun, surf, and romance. For the next three decades, Fort Lauderdale was the epicenter of Spring Break, hosting hundreds of thousands of students annually. But by the late 1980s, fed up with the chaos, the city cracked down, and Spring Break migrated to Panama City Beach, Daytona Beach, South Beach, and beyond. The tradition that Florida invented became a national rite of passage—and a recurring headache for host communities.
