# The Don CeSar: The Pink Palace of St. Pete Beach
## 1928-Present

---

## Overview

Rising like a Moorish fantasy from the white sands of St. Pete Beach, the Don CeSar Hotel—the "Pink Palace"—has been one of Florida's most distinctive landmarks since 1928. Built by Thomas Rowe as a monument to his lost love, the pink stucco castle survived the Depression, served as a military hospital in World War II, nearly met the wrecking ball in the 1960s, and emerged restored as one of Florida's grand resort hotels. Its improbable color, romantic origins, and dramatic history make it one of the state's most beloved buildings.
