# LeRoy Collins: Florida's Conscience Governor
## 1955-1961

---

## Overview

Thomas LeRoy Collins served as Florida's governor during the turbulent years of the civil rights movement, and unlike most Southern governors of his era, he refused to embrace massive resistance to desegregation. While never a civil rights crusader, Collins became known as the "South's most moderate governor," calling segregation "morally wrong" in a 1960 statewide address—words almost unthinkable from a Southern leader of that time. He later walked beside Martin Luther King Jr. at Selma as President Johnson's special representative. Collins paid a political price for his moderation, losing a 1968 Senate race, but earned a place in history as a voice of reason in an age of extremism.
