# The Johns Committee: Florida's Little McCarthy
## 1956-1965

---

## Overview

In 1956, the Florida Legislature created the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, better known as the Johns Committee after its chairman, state Senator Charley Johns. Originally formed to investigate the NAACP and opponents of segregation, the committee evolved into a witch hunt targeting homosexuals, particularly in Florida's universities. For nine years, the committee destroyed careers, ruined lives, and terrorized gay Floridians before its excesses finally ended it. The Johns Committee represents one of the darkest chapters in Florida history—a homegrown McCarthyism that combined segregationist politics with anti-gay persecution.
