# The Florida Cattle Industry: America's First Cowboys
## 1521-Present

---

## Overview

Florida's cattle industry is the oldest in North America, predating the famous Texas cattle drives by three centuries. When Ponce de León returned to Florida in 1521, he brought the first cattle to the continent. These Spanish cattle multiplied in Florida's prairies and wetlands, forming the foundation of an industry that would make Florida one of America's largest cattle-producing states. Florida's cowboys—called "cow hunters"—developed unique techniques using whips and dogs rather than lassos, adapting to the subtropical environment. Today, Florida remains a major cattle state, though the industry's character has changed dramatically from the open-range days of the Cracker cow hunters.
