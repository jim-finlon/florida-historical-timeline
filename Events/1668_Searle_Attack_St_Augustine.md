# The Pirate Raid on St. Augustine: Robert Searle's Attack
## 1668

---

## Overview

On the night of May 28, 1668, English pirate Robert Searle led a devastating raid on St. Augustine, Florida, catching the Spanish colonial capital completely by surprise. In a few hours of violence, the pirates killed approximately 60 residents—including women and children—plundered the town, desecrated the church, and escaped before Spanish reinforcements could respond. The raid exposed St. Augustine's vulnerability and prompted Spain to begin construction of the Castillo de San Marcos, the massive stone fortress that still stands today.

## The Setting

### St. Augustine in 1668

A century after its founding, St. Augustine remained a small, isolated outpost:

**The Town:**
- Population: approximately 1,500-2,000 (including soldiers, colonists, and mission Indians)
- Primarily wooden buildings
- A wooden fort (Castillo de San Marcos would not be built until after this raid)
- Economy dependent on the situado (annual subsidy from Mexico)

**Defenses:**
- Wooden palisade walls
- Small garrison (perhaps 300 soldiers)
- Limited artillery
- No permanent stone fortifications

**Isolation:**
- Nearest Spanish settlement: Havana (several days' sail)
- Surrounded by native territories
- Supply ships arrived infrequently
- Communications with Spain took months

### The Age of Piracy

The Caribbean in the 1660s was a violent frontier:

**The Buccaneers:**
- English, French, and Dutch pirates operated throughout the Caribbean
- Often held commissions (letters of marque) from their governments
- Blurred line between privateering and piracy
- Targeted Spanish ships and settlements

**International Context:**
- England and Spain were frequently at war or in tension
- Jamaica (captured by England in 1655) became a pirate haven
- Port Royal, Jamaica, was the "wickedest city on Earth"
- Spain's American empire was increasingly vulnerable

## Robert Searle

### The Man

Robert Searle (also spelled Searles) was one of many English pirates operating from Jamaica:

**Background:**
- English privateer/pirate based in Jamaica
- Held commissions to attack Spanish shipping
- Veteran of Caribbean raids
- Known for violence and daring

**Career:**
- Active throughout the 1660s
- Attacked Spanish ships and settlements
- Part of the loose confederation of English buccaneers
- The St. Augustine raid was his most famous exploit

### Motivation

Why attack St. Augustine?

**Strategic:**
- Important Spanish colonial capital
- Situated on shipping lanes
- Known to be poorly defended
- Rich pickings expected (churches, government buildings, wealthy residents)

**Personal:**
- Revenge for Spanish attacks on English traders
- Profit from plunder
- Fame among fellow pirates

**Practical:**
- St. Augustine was relatively accessible from Jamaica
- Intelligence suggested weak defenses
- The wooden fort could not resist a determined assault

---

## The Raid

### Preparation

Searle assembled his force in Jamaica:

**The Fleet:**
- Several ships (exact number uncertain)
- Mix of small, fast vessels suitable for coastal raiding

**The Force:**
- Approximately 100-150 pirates
- Experienced fighters
- Armed with muskets, pistols, cutlasses, and axes

**The Plan:**
- Approach St. Augustine by sea
- Land under cover of darkness
- Strike before the garrison could organize
- Plunder and escape before reinforcements arrived

### The Approach

In late May 1668, Searle's ships appeared off the Florida coast:

**May 28, 1668:**
- Pirates sailed into Matanzas Inlet (south of St. Augustine)
- Concealed ships behind the barrier islands
- Prepared for night attack
- Spanish lookouts apparently failed to spot them—or warnings went unheeded

### The Attack

Under cover of darkness, the pirates struck:

**The Landing:**
- Small boats carried pirates ashore
- Landed south of the town
- Moved toward St. Augustine on foot

**The Assault:**
- Attacked at night, catching residents asleep
- Burst into homes, killing and plundering
- Set fires to spread confusion
- Residents fled in panic

### The Violence

What followed was several hours of terror:

**Casualties:**
- Approximately 60 killed (some accounts say more)
- Victims included men, women, and children
- Spanish soldiers killed in confused fighting
- Some residents murdered in their beds

**Atrocities:**
- Pirates broke into the church
- Desecrated religious objects
- Stole church silver and vestments
- Burned parts of the town

**Plunder:**
- Stripped valuable from homes and buildings
- Took everything portable of value
- Captured some residents as prisoners (for ransom or slavery)

### The Escape

As dawn approached, Searle ordered withdrawal:

**Timing:**
- Spanish reinforcements might arrive at any moment
- The pirates could not hold the town
- Their mission was plunder, not conquest

**The Retreat:**
- Loaded loot onto boats
- Withdrew to their ships
- Sailed away before organized pursuit was possible

**Spanish Response:**
- Governor and garrison eventually rallied
- But too late to catch the pirates
- Left to bury the dead and assess the damage

## The Aftermath

### Immediate Impact

The raid devastated St. Augustine:

**Human Cost:**
- Approximately 60 dead
- Unknown number wounded
- Families destroyed
- Community traumatized

**Physical Damage:**
- Buildings burned
- Church desecrated
- Valuables stolen
- Infrastructure damaged

**Psychological Impact:**
- Sense of vulnerability exposed
- Spanish Florida's weakness demonstrated
- Fear of future attacks

### The Spanish Response

Spain could not ignore such a humiliation:

**Diplomatic:**
- Protests to England (largely ineffective—England denied responsibility for "pirates")
- Increased tensions between the powers
- Calls for better defense of Florida

**Military:**
- Decision to build permanent stone fortification
- **1672:** Construction began on Castillo de San Marcos
- Work would take 23 years (completed 1695)
- The coquina stone fortress would be impregnable to attack

**Administrative:**
- Reviews of colonial defense throughout Spanish Florida
- Increased garrison (though never sufficient)
- Better early warning systems

## Significance

### Catalyst for the Castillo

The most lasting impact of Searle's raid was architectural:

**Before 1668:**
- St. Augustine defended only by wooden forts
- Multiple earlier forts had rotted, burned, or been destroyed by hurricanes
- Stone seemed too expensive

**After 1668:**
- Spain committed to permanent stone fortification
- **1672:** Construction began on Castillo de San Marcos
- Coquina stone (locally available shellstone) proved ideal
- **1695:** Basic structure completed

**The Result:**
- Castillo de San Marcos became the most formidable fortress in colonial America
- Never successfully taken by assault
- Still stands today—the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States
- Now a National Monument

### Pattern of Attacks

Searle's raid was not isolated:

**Before:**
- Sir Francis Drake had attacked St. Augustine in 1586
- Various smaller raids had occurred

**After:**
- English pirates continued to threaten Florida
- Carolina colonists would later attack the missions
- The Spanish-English conflict would intensify

### Symbol of Vulnerability

The raid demonstrated that Spain's American empire was overextended:

- St. Augustine was isolated and poorly supplied
- Pirates could strike almost anywhere
- Spain lacked resources to defend everything
- The situado system was inadequate for colonial defense

## The Pirates of the Caribbean—Reality

### Who They Were

The buccaneers who attacked St. Augustine were part of a larger phenomenon:

**Origins:**
- Originally hunters on Hispaniola (buccaneer = boucanier, from smoking meat)
- Driven off by Spanish; took to the sea
- Joined by runaway sailors, escaped criminals, adventurers

**Organization:**
- Loose confederation, not formal navy
- Democratic principles (crews elected captains)
- Shared plunder according to established rules
- Base of operations: Port Royal, Jamaica; Tortuga

**Characteristics:**
- Incredibly violent
- Remarkably diverse (many nationalities, some former slaves)
- Effective fighting force
- Terrorized Spanish Caribbean for decades

### The End of the Era

The Golden Age of Piracy would not last:

- **1692:** Port Royal destroyed by earthquake
- **Early 1700s:** Piracy suppressed by English and French governments
- **1718:** Blackbeard killed in North Carolina
- **By 1730:** Golden Age effectively over

But in 1668, the buccaneers were at their height, and St. Augustine learned the cost.

## Legacy

### Historical Memory

Searle's raid is remembered in St. Augustine:

- Historical markers describe the attack
- The Castillo de San Marcos stands as permanent response
- The event appears in city histories

### Lessons

The raid teaches several lessons:

1. **Colonial vulnerability:** Even established cities could be destroyed
2. **International rivalry:** European conflicts shaped American history
3. **The cost of neglect:** Inadequate defenses invited attack
4. **Permanent solutions:** The Castillo was Spain's long-term answer
5. **Violence of the era:** Pirates showed no mercy to civilian populations

### Connecting Past and Present

Today's visitors to St. Augustine can see:

- **Castillo de San Marcos:** The fortress built in response to Searle's raid
- **Colonial quarter:** Rebuilt and expanded after the attack
- **Church buildings:** Reconstructed after the desecration
- **The bay:** Where Searle's ships anchored before the assault

The city's continued existence—and its magnificent fortress—are testaments to Spanish determination to hold Florida despite all attacks.
