# Henry Morrison Flagler: The Man Who Invented Florida
## 1830-1913

---

## Overview

No single person shaped Florida more than Henry Morrison Flagler. A co-founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller, Flagler became one of the richest men in America. In 1878, at age 48, he visited St. Augustine and saw potential where others saw a sleepy backwater. Over the next three decades, Flagler built the Florida East Coast Railway down the entire Atlantic coast, constructed grand hotels that made Florida fashionable, dredged harbors, built cities, and finally extended his railroad 128 miles over open ocean to Key West. When Flagler arrived, Florida was America's least populated state east of the Mississippi. When he died in 1913, Florida was on its way to becoming a destination for millions. Flagler didn't just develop Florida; he invented the modern tourist state.
