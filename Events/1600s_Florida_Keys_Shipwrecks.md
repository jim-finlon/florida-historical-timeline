# Shipwrecks of the Florida Keys: The Treasure Coast
## 1500s-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida Keys are one of the world's most treacherous stretches of water—a 200-mile arc of shallow reefs, hidden shoals, and swift currents that has claimed more than 1,000 ships over five centuries. Spanish treasure fleets, British warships, slave ships, blockade runners, and modern vessels have all met their ends on the Florida Reef, making the Keys one of the richest underwater archaeological sites on Earth. The wrecks have spawned industries: the 19th-century wrecking business made Key West the richest city per capita in America, while modern treasure hunting has pulled millions in gold and silver from the seafloor. Today, many wrecks are protected as part of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
