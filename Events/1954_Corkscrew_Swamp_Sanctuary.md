# Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary: The Last Great Bald Cypress Forest
## 1954-Present

---

## Overview

Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, managed by the National Audubon Society, protects the largest remaining stand of virgin bald cypress in North America—ancient trees up to 600 years old rising from a primeval swamp that has never been logged. Located in Collier County near Naples, this 13,000-acre preserve contains one of the most important wood stork nesting colonies in the United States and harbors ghost orchids, black bears, and the endangered Florida panther. A 2.25-mile boardwalk allows visitors to walk through ecosystems unchanged since before Columbus, experiencing Florida as it was before drainage and development transformed the landscape.
