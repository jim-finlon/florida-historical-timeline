# Torreya State Park: Florida's Appalachian Outpost
## 1935-Present

---

## Overview

Torreya State Park, perched on the dramatic bluffs of the Apalachicola River in Florida's Panhandle, preserves one of the state's most unusual landscapes—steep ravines, ancient Appalachian plants, and the critically endangered Florida torreya tree, found naturally nowhere else on Earth. Rising 150 feet above the river, the park's limestone bluffs create a microclimate that shelters species more commonly found hundreds of miles to the north, including rare wildflowers, mosses, and the distinctive stinking cedar (torreya). The park also includes the restored Gregory House, a mid-19th century plantation home moved here in 1935. Established during the Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps, Torreya remains one of Florida's most surprising and botanically significant natural areas.
