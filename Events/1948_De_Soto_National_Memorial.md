# De Soto National Memorial: Where the Conquistadors Landed
## 1539 / 1948

---

## Overview

On May 30, 1539, Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto landed near Tampa Bay with 620 men, 220 horses, and a mission to find gold and conquer a continent. His four-year, 4,000-mile expedition through the American Southeast would end in failure and death, but it was the first major European exploration of what is now the United States. De Soto National Memorial, established in 1948 on the shores of Tampa Bay near Bradenton, commemorates this fateful landing and explores both the Spanish conquest and the Native American civilizations it devastated. Each winter, costumed interpreters recreate the landing, demonstrating armor, weapons, and the technology of conquest.
