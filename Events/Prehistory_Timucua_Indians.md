# The Timucua: Florida's Largest Native Nation
## Prehistory-1700s

---

## Overview

When Europeans first arrived in Florida, the Timucua were the largest and most widespread Native American group in the region—perhaps 200,000 people speaking related dialects and occupying most of northern Florida and parts of southern Georgia. They were the first Native Americans in North America to be extensively depicted by a European artist, when Jacques Le Moyne drew them for the French at Fort Caroline in 1564. The Timucua built the great shell mounds, developed complex chiefdoms, and became the primary targets of Spanish missionary efforts. By 1700, disease, slave raids, and colonial violence had reduced them to a few hundred survivors; by the mid-1700s, they had ceased to exist as a distinct people, leaving only archaeological remains and the remarkable Le Moyne drawings to testify to their civilization.
