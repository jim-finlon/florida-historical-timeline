# Gamble Plantation: The Last Antebellum Mansion of South Florida
## 1850-Present

---

## Overview

The Gamble Plantation near Bradenton is the only surviving plantation house in South Florida and one of the most important antebellum sites in the state. Built around 1850 by Major Robert Gamble using slave labor, the mansion was the center of a 3,500-acre sugar plantation worked by nearly 200 enslaved people. The estate produced sugar and molasses until the Civil War destroyed the plantation system. Most notably, the house sheltered Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin as he fled Federal troops after the war—making it the only Confederate memorial in Florida. Today, the mansion stands as a rare reminder of the slave-based plantation economy that once existed even in subtropical Florida.
