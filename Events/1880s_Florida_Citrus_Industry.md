# The Florida Citrus Industry: Orange Gold
## 1880s-Present

---

## Overview

Florida oranges became one of America's most iconic agricultural products—a symbol of sunshine, health, and the promise of the tropical state. The citrus industry transformed Florida from a frontier backwater into an agricultural powerhouse, drawing railroads, creating fortunes, and reshaping the landscape. Though oranges came to Florida with the Spanish in the 1500s, the commercial industry exploded after the Civil War and the arrival of the railroads. Devastating freezes, changing economics, and urbanization have continually reshaped the industry, but Florida oranges remain central to the state's identity and economy, even as the groves give way to housing developments.
