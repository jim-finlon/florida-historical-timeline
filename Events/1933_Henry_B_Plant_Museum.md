# Henry B. Plant Museum: The Gilded Age in Tampa
## 1933-Present

---

## Overview

The Henry B. Plant Museum, occupying a wing of the magnificent Tampa Bay Hotel that railroad magnate Henry B. Plant built in 1891, preserves the opulence and history of Florida's Gilded Age in one of America's most exuberant Victorian buildings. The museum showcases original furnishings from the hotel's grand era, when Plant transformed Tampa from a sleepy village into a booming port city connected to his railroad empire. With its distinctive Moorish Revival minarets rising above the Hillsborough River, the former hotel—now part of the University of Tampa—and its museum tell the story of the visionary who brought development, tourism, and the Spanish-American War to Florida's Gulf Coast.
