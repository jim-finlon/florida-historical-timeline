# Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan: Replumbing the Everglades
## 2000-Present

---

## Overview

The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), authorized by Congress in 2000, is the largest ecosystem restoration project in American history, aiming to restore the natural flow of water through the Everglades while maintaining flood control and water supply for South Florida's 8 million residents. The $23 billion, multi-decade project represents an extraordinary attempt to reverse a century of drainage that converted half of the original Everglades to agriculture and development. Though progress has been slower and costs higher than initially projected, CERP represents an unprecedented commitment to undoing environmental damage and remains a model for large-scale ecological restoration worldwide.
