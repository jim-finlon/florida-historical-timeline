# The Tampa Bay Hotel: Henry Plant's Moorish Palace
## 1891-Present

---

## Overview

When Henry Plant opened his Tampa Bay Hotel in 1891, he created one of the most fantastical buildings in American history—a quarter-mile-long Moorish Revival palace crowned with silver minarets, onion domes, and crescent moons that rose improbably from the Florida scrub. Plant spent $3 million on construction and another $500,000 filling it with European antiques, Asian art, and exotic furnishings. The hotel transformed Tampa from a sleepy village into a winter resort destination and served as Theodore Roosevelt's headquarters during the Spanish-American War. Today the building houses the University of Tampa and the Henry B. Plant Museum, its minarets still glittering over the Hillsborough River as a reminder of one man's outsized vision.
