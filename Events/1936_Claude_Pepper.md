# Claude Pepper: Florida's Liberal Warrior
## 1900-1989

---

## Overview

For over half a century, Claude Denson Pepper was the most consequential political figure Florida ever produced. First elected to the U.S. Senate in 1936, Pepper became a champion of the New Deal, an early advocate of civil rights, and one of America's most liberal voices. Though defeated in a notorious red-baiting campaign in 1950, he returned to Congress in 1962 as a representative from Miami, where he became the nation's foremost champion of senior citizens. His work on Social Security, Medicare, and the abolition of mandatory retirement made him a hero to millions of older Americans. Pepper's career spanned the transformation of both Florida and America.
