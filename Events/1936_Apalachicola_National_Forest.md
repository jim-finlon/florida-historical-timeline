# Apalachicola National Forest: Florida's Largest National Forest
## 1936-Present

---

## Overview

Apalachicola National Forest, spanning nearly 640,000 acres across four Florida Panhandle counties, is the largest national forest in Florida and one of the most ecologically significant public lands in the southeastern United States. Established in 1936, the forest protects vast expanses of longleaf pine-wiregrass savanna, pitcher plant bogs, hardwood swamps, and blackwater rivers that together harbor more rare and endangered species than almost any comparable area in the country. The forest is home to the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker, the carnivorous pitcher plants of its seepage bogs, and the Florida black bear. For generations, it has provided hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation for Floridians while demonstrating that working forests can coexist with conservation.
