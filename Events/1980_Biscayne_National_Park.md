# Biscayne National Park: The Underwater Wilderness
## 1968/1980-Present

---

## Overview

Biscayne National Park, located just south of Miami, protects 173,000 acres of which 95% is water—making it one of the largest marine parks in the National Park System. The park encompasses Biscayne Bay, a portion of the world's third-largest barrier reef, and a chain of northernmost Florida Keys, preserving an aquatic wilderness in the shadow of America's eighth-largest metropolitan area. Established first as a national monument in 1968 (to prevent a proposed oil refinery and causeway) and elevated to national park status in 1980, Biscayne protects critical habitat for manatees, sea turtles, and hundreds of fish species while offering snorkeling, diving, and boating to visitors seeking natural Florida within sight of Miami's skyline.
