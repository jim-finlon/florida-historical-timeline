# Carl Fisher: The Man Who Created Miami Beach
## 1913-1939

---

## Overview

In 1913, Carl Graham Fisher looked at a mangrove-covered sandbar across Biscayne Bay from Miami and saw something no one else did: America's premier winter playground. A self-made millionaire from automobile headlights, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and the Lincoln Highway, Fisher poured his fortune into dredging, filling, and developing what would become Miami Beach. Where there had been jungle and swamp, he created hotels, polo fields, golf courses, and the most glamorous beach resort of the 1920s. Fisher's promotional genius—including publicity stunts with elephants and celebrities—made Miami Beach synonymous with wealth, fun, and sunshine, creating a template for Florida resort development that persists today.
