# William Bartram's Travels: Florida's First Nature Writer
## 1773-1777

---

## Overview

In 1773, Philadelphia naturalist William Bartram set out on a four-year journey through the American Southeast that would produce one of the most beautiful and influential books about the natural world ever written. His *Travels*, published in 1791, described a Florida of crystal springs, alligator bellowing, vast bird colonies, and Seminole villages with a romantic intensity that influenced Coleridge, Wordsworth, and generations of nature writers. Bartram was the first to describe many Florida species scientifically, the first to record Seminole culture sympathetically, and the creator of an enduring vision of Florida as natural paradise. His journey along the St. Johns River remains one of the founding documents of American environmental literature.
