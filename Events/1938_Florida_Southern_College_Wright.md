# Florida Southern College: Frank Lloyd Wright's Child of the Sun
## 1938-1958

---

## Overview

Florida Southern College in Lakeland is home to the world's largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture—13 structures designed by America's greatest architect as part of his vision for an "organic" campus that would grow from the Florida landscape. Wright called it his "Child of the Sun," integrating his buildings with citrus groves, lakes, and the subtropical climate through covered walkways called "esplanades," locally-sourced materials, and dramatic geometric forms. Built largely by student labor between 1938 and 1958, the campus represents Wright's most comprehensive vision of educational architecture and stands as one of Florida's most significant cultural treasures.
