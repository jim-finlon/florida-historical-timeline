# Florida Caverns State Park: The Underground World
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

Florida Caverns State Park near Marianna contains Florida's only publicly accessible air-filled caves—a remarkable geological anomaly in a state better known for underwater springs than underground chambers. The caverns display spectacular formations of stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, and draperies created over millions of years as water dissolved the limestone and redeposited it in fantastic shapes. Used by Native Americans for shelter and ceremony, explored by Civil War soldiers, and developed as a state park by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, Florida Caverns offers visitors a chance to experience a hidden world beneath the Sunshine State.

- Rare air-filled chambers
- Panhandle location

### Formation

**The Process:**
- Acidic water dissolves limestone
- Chambers form
- Minerals redeposited
- Formations grow

**The Timescale:**
- Millions of years
- Slow accumulation
- Ongoing process
- Ancient features
