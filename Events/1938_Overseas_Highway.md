# The Overseas Highway: Driving to Key West
## 1938-Present

---

## Overview

When the Overseas Highway opened in 1938, it accomplished what Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad had done a quarter century earlier—connecting the Florida Keys to the mainland—but this time by automobile. Built largely on the abandoned railroad right-of-way after the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane destroyed Flagler's tracks, the highway made Key West accessible to ordinary Americans for the first time. The modern version, completed in 1982 with new bridges replacing the old railroad trestles, carries millions of visitors annually across 113 miles of ocean, crossing 42 bridges including the famous Seven Mile Bridge. It remains one of the most spectacular drives in the world, a ribbon of concrete spanning the blue-green waters of the Florida Straits.
