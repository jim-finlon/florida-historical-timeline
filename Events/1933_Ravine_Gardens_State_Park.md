# Ravine Gardens State Park: The WPA's Gift to Palatka
## 1933-Present

---

## Overview

Ravine Gardens State Park in Palatka showcases one of the finest examples of Works Progress Administration (WPA) landscaping in the United States—a dramatic 59-acre garden built into the steep ravines carved by ancient streams into Florida's central ridge. Developed between 1933 and 1943 as a Depression-era work relief project, the park features over 95,000 azaleas and camellias planted along winding paths that descend into ravines 120 feet deep, crossed by ornamental bridges and graced by stone walls and structures built by WPA workers. Each spring, the Florida Azalea Festival celebrates the spectacular bloom that draws visitors from across the region to witness the ravines ablaze with color.
