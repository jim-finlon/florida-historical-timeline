# Bass Museum of Art: Miami Beach's Art Deco Treasure House
## 1964-Present

---

## Overview

The Bass Museum of Art, housed in a 1930s Art Deco building in Miami Beach's Collins Park, presents an eclectic collection spanning 500 years of European art alongside dynamic contemporary exhibitions. Founded in 1964 with the collection of John and Johanna Bass—Austrian-born art collectors who made Miami Beach their home—the museum occupies a former library building that has been thoughtfully expanded while preserving its original Art Deco character. The 2017 expansion by architect Arata Isozaki transformed the museum into a contemporary art destination while honoring its historic architecture and the Bass family's founding vision.
