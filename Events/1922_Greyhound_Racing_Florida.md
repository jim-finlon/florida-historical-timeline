# Greyhound Racing in Florida: The Sport of Queens Falls
## 1922-2020

---

## Overview

Greyhound racing arrived in Florida in 1922 and for decades was one of the state's most popular gambling attractions, with dozens of tracks operating from Pensacola to Miami. At its peak, Florida was home to more greyhound tracks than any other state, generating billions in wagering and tax revenue. However, declining attendance, changing attitudes about animal welfare, and gambling competition led to the sport's dramatic decline. In 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment banning commercial dog racing, and by December 2020, the last tracks closed, ending nearly a century of greyhound racing in the Sunshine State.
