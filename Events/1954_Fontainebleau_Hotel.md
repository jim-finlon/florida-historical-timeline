# The Fontainebleau: Miami Beach's Mid-Century Palace
## 1954-Present

---

## Overview

When the Fontainebleau Hotel opened on Miami Beach in 1954, it announced a new era of American glamour—a sweeping curve of white concrete and glass designed by Morris Lapidus in a style the architect called "the architecture of joy." The Fontainebleau became the symbol of postwar Miami Beach: a playground for the middle class that felt like a palace, where Frank Sinatra performed, where the Rat Pack gathered, and where James Bond films were shot. Lapidus, initially mocked by architectural critics, created what became the most influential hotel design of the 20th century. The Fontainebleau democratized luxury, proving that grandeur wasn't just for the wealthy, and its curved facade remains the defining image of Miami Beach's golden age.
