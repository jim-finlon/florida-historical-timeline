# Operation Pedro Pan: The Children's Exodus from Cuba
## 1960-1962

---

## Overview

Between December 1960 and October 1962, over 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban children were flown to the United States in the largest child refugee airlift in Western Hemisphere history. Operation Pedro Pan (Peter Pan) was organized by the Catholic Church, the U.S. government, and Cuban parents desperate to save their children from communist indoctrination. Miami became the gateway, with Catholic Charities housing and caring for the children until they could be reunited with their families—some within months, others not for years, and some never. The Pedro Pan children grew up to become doctors, lawyers, judges, and business leaders, but they carried the trauma of separation forever.
