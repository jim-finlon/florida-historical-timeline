# Pensacola: America's First European Settlement
## 1559-Present

---

## Overview

Pensacola, situated on a magnificent natural harbor on Florida's Gulf Coast, lays claim to hosting America's first European settlement when Spanish explorer Tristán de Luna established a colony in 1559—six years before St. Augustine. Though Luna's settlement failed within two years, Pensacola was permanently settled in 1698 and has since flown five flags (Spain, France, Britain, the United States, and the Confederacy), earning it the nickname "The City of Five Flags." Home to the nation's first naval air station and anchored by a strong military presence, Pensacola blends deep history with beach resort culture in Florida's western Panhandle.
