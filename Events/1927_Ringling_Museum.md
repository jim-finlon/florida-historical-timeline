# The Ringling Museum: A Circus King's Legacy
## 1927-Present

---

## Overview

On the shores of Sarasota Bay, circus magnate John Ringling built one of America's great art museums—a Mediterranean palace housing Old Master paintings, set amid Italian-inspired gardens, with a full-scale replica of a Venetian palazzo and one of the world's great circus collections. Ringling, who with his brothers built the greatest circus empire in history, spent his fortune acquiring Baroque masterpieces, creating a 66-acre estate that he bequeathed to the people of Florida. Today, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art is Florida's state art museum, an unlikely cultural oasis that reflects both the grandeur and the strangeness of Florida's Gilded Age.
