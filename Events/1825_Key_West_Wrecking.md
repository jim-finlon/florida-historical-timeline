# The Key West Wrecking Industry
## 1825-1900: Riches from the Reef

---

## Overview

For most of the nineteenth century, Key West was the wealthiest city per capita in the United States, and its fortune came from disaster. Ships sailing between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico had to navigate the treacherous Florida Reef, and many didn't make it. Key West's "wreckers" stood ready to salvage the cargo, rescue the passengers, and claim their legally entitled share of the goods. At its peak, the wrecking industry made Key West Florida's largest city and created an aristocracy of sea captains who built the elegant Victorian homes that still grace the island. It was a peculiar economy built on the misfortune of others—legal, regulated, and enormously profitable.
