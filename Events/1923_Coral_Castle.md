# Coral Castle: The Mystery of Edward Leedskalnin
## 1923-1951

---

## Overview

Between 1923 and 1951, a diminutive Latvian immigrant named Edward Leedskalnin single-handedly carved and moved over 1,100 tons of coral rock to create one of Florida's strangest monuments—a castle-like structure he called "Rock Gate Park," now known as Coral Castle. Working alone, mostly at night, using only hand tools, the 5-foot-tall, 100-pound Leedskalnin created massive stone structures including a 9-ton gate so perfectly balanced it could be opened with a finger. He never revealed his methods, fueling decades of speculation about ancient secrets, magnetic forces, and supernatural powers. The Coral Castle remains one of Florida's most mysterious attractions and an enduring monument to heartbreak, obsession, and inexplicable engineering.
