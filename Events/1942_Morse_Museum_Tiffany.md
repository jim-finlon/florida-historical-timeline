# The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art: The World's Tiffany Treasury
## 1942-Present

---

## Overview

The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park houses the world's most comprehensive collection of works by Louis Comfort Tiffany, including the spectacular chapel interior he designed for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. What began as Jeannette Genius McKean's passion for collecting Tiffany's luminous stained glass windows, lamps, and decorative arts has grown into an internationally renowned museum holding thousands of Tiffany objects—from iconic leaded glass lamps to architectural elements salvaged from his legendary Laurelton Hall estate. The museum stands as both a tribute to America's greatest decorative artist and a testament to one family's dedication to preserving his legacy.
