# Black Caesar: The Pirate of the Florida Keys
## Early 1700s

---

## Overview

Black Caesar is one of the most legendary figures in Florida piracy—a formerly enslaved African who escaped bondage and became a feared pirate operating from the Florida Keys in the early 18th century. While the historical record is murky, mixing fact with legend, the story holds that Caesar established a base on what is now Caesar Creek between Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key, where he captured passing ships and accumulated treasure. He allegedly served with the notorious Blackbeard before both were killed in the famous battle with Lieutenant Robert Maynard in 1718. Whether all the tales are true, Black Caesar remains an enduring figure in Florida folklore and a symbol of resistance against slavery and colonial power.
