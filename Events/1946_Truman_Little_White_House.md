# Harry S. Truman Little White House: The President's Key West Retreat
## 1890-Present

---

## Overview

The Harry S. Truman Little White House in Key West served as the "Winter White House" for President Harry S. Truman, who made eleven visits totaling 175 days during his presidency. Built in 1890 as quarters for the commandant of the Key West Naval Station, the modest clapboard building became Truman's beloved escape from Washington, where he swam, played poker, made critical Cold War decisions, and famously wore his Hawaiian shirts. The house also hosted Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Carter, and Clinton. Now a museum, the Little White House preserves the rooms where Truman relaxed and governed, offering visitors an intimate glimpse into presidential life away from the capital.
