# St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge: Where the Panhandle Meets the Gulf
## 1931-Present

---

## Overview

St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1931, protects nearly 70,000 acres of pristine Gulf Coast wilderness in Florida's Big Bend region—a landscape of salt marshes, pine flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and coastal hammocks where the Panhandle curves south to meet the Peninsula. One of the oldest refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System, St. Marks is anchored by the historic St. Marks Lighthouse, built in 1842 and still operational today. The refuge serves as a critical wintering ground for migratory waterfowl, a year-round home to black bears, wild turkeys, and alligators, and one of the most important monarch butterfly staging areas on the Gulf Coast.
