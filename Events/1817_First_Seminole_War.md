# The First Seminole War
## 1817-1818

---

## Overview

The First Seminole War (1817-1818) was less a formal war than a violent American invasion of Spanish Florida, led by General Andrew Jackson. Ostensibly pursuing Seminole raiders and escaped enslaved people, Jackson's forces swept through Florida, destroyed Seminole villages, captured Spanish forts, and executed two British subjects—all while Spain nominally controlled the territory. The invasion demonstrated Spain's inability to govern Florida and directly led to the Adams-Onís Treaty, by which Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819.

## The Setting

### Florida's Powder Keg

By 1817, Florida had become an explosive mix:

**Spanish Weakness:**
- Spain could not control its colony
- Minimal military presence
- No resources to govern effectively
- Caught between Seminoles and Americans

**Seminole Resistance:**
- Seminole villages throughout North Florida
- Warriors raided into Georgia, then retreated to Florida
- Florida served as sanctuary from American retaliation

**Escaped Slaves:**
- Thousands of enslaved people had escaped to Florida
- Black Seminole communities flourished
- American slaveholders demanded their return
- Spain could not/would not return them

**American Pressure:**
- Georgia frontier settlers demanding action
- Slaveholders insisting on return of "property"
- Expansionists eyeing Florida for annexation
- Border violence escalating

### The Negro Fort Incident (1816)

A year before the war, events foreshadowed the conflict:

**Background:**
- During War of 1812, British built fort on Apalachicola River
- Armed and supplied native allies and escaped slaves
- After British departure, fort occupied by approximately 300 free Blacks and 30 Seminoles

**The Attack:**
- American military considered the "Negro Fort" intolerable
- July 1816: U.S. forces attacked
- A "hot shot" (heated cannonball) struck the powder magazine
- The resulting explosion killed approximately 270 people
- Survivors were returned to slavery or killed

**Significance:**
- Demonstrated American willingness to invade Spanish territory
- Enraged Seminoles and Black Seminoles
- Escalated cycle of violence

## The War Begins

### Immediate Causes

By late 1817, violence spiraled out of control:

**Seminole Raids:**
- Warriors attacked settlements in Georgia
- Killed settlers, took prisoners
- Fled back across Florida border

**American Response:**
- Georgia militia pursued into Florida
- Attacked Seminole village of Fowltown (November 1817)
- Killed several Seminoles, including women

**The Scott Massacre:**
- Seminoles retaliated by attacking a supply boat on the Apalachicola
- Approximately 40 soldiers, women, and children killed
- Outrage in Georgia and Washington

### Andrew Jackson Takes Command

President Monroe ordered military action:

**The Orders:**
- General Jackson authorized to pursue Seminoles into Florida
- Instructions ambiguous about how far he could go
- Jackson interpreted them broadly

**Jackson's Force:**
- Approximately 3,000 men
- Regular U.S. Army troops
- Tennessee and Georgia militia
- Creek allies (enemies of the Seminoles)

**Jackson's Character:**
- Aggressive, ruthless, effective
- Hated British and Native Americans
- Would later become President
- Already a national hero from the War of 1812

## The Campaign

### Jackson's March

In early 1818, Jackson swept through Florida:

**March 1818:**
- Crossed into Florida with his army
- Burned every Seminole village encountered
- Destroyed crops and captured livestock
- Seminoles fled before the advancing army

**Capture of St. Marks (April 7, 1818):**
- Jackson seized the Spanish fort at St. Marks
- Spain protested but could not resist
- Two British subjects captured: Alexander Arbuthnot (trader) and Robert Ambrister (adventurer)

**Execution of British Subjects:**
- Jackson accused them of aiding Seminoles
- Court-martial convicted both
- Arbuthnot hanged; Ambrister shot
- Created international incident with Britain

**Capture of Pensacola (May 1818):**
- Jackson marched west across Florida
- Seized Pensacola, the Spanish colonial capital
- Deposed the Spanish governor
- Raised the American flag

### Seminole Resistance

The Seminoles could not stand against Jackson's force:

**Tactics:**
- Seminoles avoided pitched battles
- Fled into swamps and forests
- Used guerrilla tactics when possible
- Could not protect their villages and crops

**Losses:**
- Hundreds killed in fighting and village destructions
- Villages burned, food supplies destroyed
- Forced to flee deeper into the Florida wilderness
- Chiefs like Billy Bowlegs and others became targets

**Black Seminoles:**
- Particularly targeted
- Many captured and returned to slavery
- Others fled with Seminoles into interior

## The Aftermath

### International Crisis

Jackson's actions created diplomatic firestorms:

**With Spain:**
- Spanish protested invasion of their territory
- Demanded return of captured forts
- But could not compel American action
- Exposed Spain's complete inability to control Florida

**With Britain:**
- Execution of Arbuthnot and Ambrister outraged Britain
- War with Britain seemed possible
- Ultimately, Britain chose not to fight over two adventurers

**In Washington:**
- Some in Congress wanted to censure Jackson
- Secretary of State John Quincy Adams defended him
- Jackson's popularity protected him
- The affair was smoothed over

### Spain Concedes

The invasion convinced Spain to sell Florida:

**The Reality:**
- Spain could not control Florida
- The United States would continue invading
- Holding Florida was expensive and pointless
- Better to sell than have it taken

**Adams-Onís Treaty (1819):**
- Negotiations began immediately after the war
- Signed February 22, 1819
- Spain ceded Florida to the United States
- Took effect 1821

## Significance

### Demonstration of American Power

The war showed that the United States could and would:

- Invade foreign territory at will
- Ignore international law when convenient
- Use overwhelming force against Native Americans
- Face minimal consequences for aggression

### Path to Annexation

The war directly led to Florida becoming American:

- Proved Spain could not hold Florida
- Created political momentum for acquisition
- Adams used the situation to negotiate the treaty
- Florida became U.S. territory by 1821

### Pattern for Future Conflicts

The First Seminole War established patterns for the larger wars to come:

**Seminole Strategy:**
- Avoid pitched battles
- Use Florida's terrain for defense
- Retreat deeper into the wilderness
- Survive rather than defeat the Americans

**American Strategy:**
- Overwhelming force
- Destroy villages and food supplies
- Force removal or extermination
- Use native allies against target tribes

### Jackson's Rise

The war enhanced Andrew Jackson's national stature:

- Already a hero, now even more famous
- Demonstrated his aggressive, decisive leadership
- Made him a popular figure for president
- The same ruthlessness would characterize his Indian Removal policies

## Legacy

### Seminole Survival

Despite the destruction, the Seminoles survived:

- Retreated into interior Florida
- Rebuilt villages and communities
- Would face two more wars (1835-1842 and 1855-1858)
- Ultimately, a remnant remained in Florida, never surrendering

### The Question of Slavery

The war highlighted slavery's centrality:

- American invasion driven partly by desire to recover escaped slaves
- Black Seminole communities particular targets
- Demonstrated that Florida as refuge was intolerable to slaveholders
- Set stage for ongoing conflicts over escaped slaves

### Precedent for Expansion

The war established precedents for American expansion:

- Aggressive military action without formal declaration of war
- Invasion of foreign territory to pursue native peoples
- Creation of facts on the ground to force diplomatic solutions
- Use of native policy to advance territorial ambitions
