# The Adams-Onís Treaty: Spain Cedes Florida
## February 22, 1819

---

## Overview

On February 22, 1819—the anniversary of George Washington's birth—American Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and Spanish Minister Luis de Onís signed the treaty that would transfer Florida from Spain to the United States. Also known as the Transcontinental Treaty, this agreement ended three centuries of Spanish presence in Florida, resolved the boundary between Spanish and American territories from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, and marked a decisive moment in the expansion of the United States across North America.

## The Setting

### Spain's Crumbling Empire

By 1819, Spain was in crisis:

**European Wars:**
- Napoleon had invaded Spain (1808)
- Spanish monarchy overthrown, then restored
- Country exhausted by decades of warfare
- Limited resources for colonial defense

**Colonial Rebellions:**
- Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Argentina fighting for independence
- Spain losing control of its American empire
- Florida was peripheral to these larger crises
- No resources to spare for a distant, unprofitable colony

**Florida's Situation:**
- Weak military presence
- Constant American encroachments
- Unable to control Seminoles or escaped slaves
- After Jackson's 1818 invasion, clearly indefensible

### American Ambitions

The United States had long coveted Florida:

**Strategic Value:**
- Control of Gulf coast
- Elimination of foreign power on borders
- Security for southern states
- Ports and harbors of commercial value

**Slavery Concerns:**
- Florida as refuge for escaped slaves
- Black Seminole communities infuriated slaveholders
- Need to close the escape route

**Manifest Destiny:**
- Growing belief in American right to continental expansion
- Florida seen as naturally American territory
- Spain's weakness presented opportunity

## The Negotiations

### The Negotiators

Two skilled diplomats faced each other:

**John Quincy Adams (1767-1848):**
- U.S. Secretary of State under President Monroe
- Experienced diplomat (had served in Russia, Britain, Netherlands)
- Brilliant, stubborn, determined
- Son of President John Adams
- Would later become President himself (1825-1829)

**Luis de Onís y González-Vara (1762-1827):**
- Spanish Minister to the United States
- Experienced diplomat and negotiator
- Fought hard to protect Spanish interests
- Working with a weak hand
- Knew Florida was lost; tried to salvage what he could

### Years of Discussion

Negotiations had been ongoing since 1818:

**Points of Contention:**
- Boundaries of the cession (how much of West Florida?)
- Status of Spanish land grants in Florida
- Compensation to Spain (Americans refused direct payment)
- Western boundary (how far did Spanish territory extend?)
- Texas (Americans wanted it; Spain refused)

**Jackson's Invasion (1818):**
- Strengthened American position
- Demonstrated Spanish inability to control Florida
- Made clear the U.S. would take Florida regardless
- But also created diplomatic complications

## The Treaty

### Key Provisions

**Signed:** February 22, 1819
**Official Name:** Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and Limits Between the United States of America and His Catholic Majesty

**Article 2 - Florida Ceded:**
- Spain ceded East and West Florida to the United States
- All Spanish claims east of the Mississippi transferred
- Complete sovereignty passed to the U.S.

**Article 3 - Western Boundary:**
- Established boundary from Gulf of Mexico to Pacific Ocean
- United States renounced claims to Texas
- Spain ceded claims to Oregon Country
- The first "transcontinental" boundary in U.S. history

**Article 11 - Land Grants:**
- Spanish land grants made before January 24, 1818, recognized as valid
- Later grants (made after Spain agreed to sell) void
- Created enduring legal complexities

**Financial Terms:**
- Spain received no direct payment
- United States assumed liability for $5 million in claims by American citizens against Spain
- Americans who had suffered losses from Spanish actions would be compensated

### The "Transcontinental" Aspect

The treaty extended far beyond Florida:

**The Boundary Line:**
- From the mouth of the Sabine River (Louisiana-Texas border)
- North along the Sabine
- West along the Red River
- North to the Arkansas River
- West along the Arkansas to its source
- North to the 42nd parallel
- West along that line to the Pacific Ocean

**Implications:**
- Fixed the Louisiana Purchase's western and southwestern boundaries
- Gave U.S. claims to Pacific Northwest (Oregon Country)
- Established that Texas was Spanish (later Mexican) territory
- Created the shape of the future American Southwest

## The Story

### The Final Negotiation

The negotiations that led to the February 22 signing had been long and contentious. Adams and Onís had argued over boundaries, over compensation, over the validity of Spanish land grants. Each sought advantage; neither wanted war.

Onís knew Spain could not hold Florida. The question was what Spain could gain by surrendering it. He fought for:
- Recognition of Texas as Spanish
- Compensation for Florida
- Protection of Spanish land grants
- A favorable transcontinental boundary

Adams was willing to give up Texas (for now) but refused direct payment. He offered assumption of claims and recognition of some land grants. The transcontinental boundary was Adams's masterstroke—trading Texas for access to the Pacific.

### Signing Day

On February 22, 1819, the two diplomats met at the State Department in Washington. The date was symbolic—George Washington's birthday, a celebration of American nationhood.

The documents were prepared in English and Spanish. Adams and Onís reviewed the final texts. Then, with the scratching of quills on parchment, they signed away 300 years of Spanish Florida.

For Adams, it was triumph. For Onís, it was the best possible outcome of a lost cause.

### Ratification Delays

The treaty's path to implementation was rocky:

**Spanish Delays:**
- King Ferdinand VII hesitated to ratify
- Hoped to extract more concessions
- Concerned about land grant provisions
- Domestic political considerations

**American Frustration:**
- Congress ratified quickly (February 1819)
- Adams grew impatient with Spanish delays
- Threats to simply take Florida increased

**Final Ratification:**
- Spain finally ratified: October 24, 1820
- United States re-ratified: February 19, 1821
- Exchange of ratifications: February 22, 1821
- Exactly two years after signing

## The Transfer

### Implementation (1821)

The actual transfer took place in mid-1821:

**East Florida:**
- July 10, 1821: Spanish governor formally surrendered St. Augustine
- Andrew Jackson (appointed as territorial governor) received the province
- Spanish troops departed
- American flag raised over the Castillo

**West Florida:**
- July 17, 1821: Pensacola transferred
- Similar ceremony of surrender
- Spanish garrison departed

**Jackson's Brief Tenure:**
- Served as first American governor for only a few months
- Quarreled with Spanish officials over delays
- Resigned in frustration
- But the transfer was complete

### What Transferred

The United States received:

**Territory:**
- Approximately 65,000 square miles
- All of modern Florida
- Parts of modern Alabama and Mississippi (west of the Perdido River)

**Facilities:**
- St. Augustine with Castillo de San Marcos
- Pensacola with its harbor and fortifications
- Other Spanish posts and improvements

**Complications:**
- Spanish land grants (still being adjudicated decades later)
- Seminole population (unresolved)
- Escaped slave communities (explosive issue)
