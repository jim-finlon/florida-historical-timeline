# The Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens: Jacksonville's Cultural Jewel
## 1958-Present

---

## Overview

The Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens, located on the banks of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, is the largest fine arts museum in Northeast Florida and home to one of the finest collections of Meissen porcelain in the world. Founded in 1958 from the bequest of Ninah May Holden Cummer, the museum occupies the site of her former estate, where historic gardens designed by the Olmsted Brothers and Ellen Biddle Shipman cascade down to the river. The collection spans 4,000 years of art, from ancient objects to contemporary works, with particular strengths in American and European paintings. The Cummer represents Jacksonville's most significant cultural institution and one of the South's premier art museums.
