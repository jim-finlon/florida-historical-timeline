# The Florida Holocaust Museum: Bearing Witness in St. Petersburg
## 1992-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg is the fourth-largest Holocaust museum in the United States and one of the most significant institutions of its kind in the world. Founded in 1992 by a group of Tampa Bay Holocaust survivors who wanted to ensure that their experiences would never be forgotten, the museum tells the story of the Holocaust from the rise of Nazism through the liberation of the concentration camps. Housed since 1998 in a 27,000-square-foot building in downtown St. Petersburg, the museum features artifacts, survivor testimonies, and educational programs that reach hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, carrying forward the survivors' mission: to teach the dangers of hatred, racism, and indifference.
