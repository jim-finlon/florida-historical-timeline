# Ocala National Forest: The Sand Pine Frontier
## 1908-Present

---

## Overview

The Ocala National Forest, established in 1908, is the oldest national forest east of the Mississippi River and the southernmost national forest in the continental United States. Its 387,000 acres in Central Florida encompass the world's largest contiguous sand pine scrub forest, hundreds of natural springs, and vast tracts of longleaf pine—habitat for black bears, Florida scrub jays, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. The forest has served as a refuge for moonshiners, a training ground for soldiers, and a recreation destination for millions, all while protecting a globally significant ecosystem found nowhere else on Earth.
