## Overview

HistoryMiami, the premier cultural institution documenting the history of South Florida, preserves more than 10 million photographic images, oral histories, documents, and artifacts spanning the region's story from prehistoric times to the present. Founded in 1940 as the Historical Association of Southern Florida, the museum has grown into a comprehensive history center that tells the complex story of a region shaped by Native American heritage, Spanish colonization, Caribbean immigration, and explosive 20th-century growth.
