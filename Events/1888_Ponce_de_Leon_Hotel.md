# The Ponce de León Hotel: Flagler's First Palace
## 1888-Present

---

## Overview

Before Henry Flagler built Palm Beach or Miami, he created the Ponce de León Hotel in St. Augustine—a Spanish Renaissance masterpiece that was the first major poured concrete building in America, the most luxurious hotel in the world when it opened, and the structure that launched Florida's transformation from malarial backwater to vacation paradise. The Ponce de León, designed by Thomas Hastings and John Carrère, combined Old World grandeur with modern technology: electric lights throughout, running water in every room, and a magnificence that announced Flagler's vision for Florida. Today, the building serves as the centerpiece of Flagler College, its original splendor preserved for new generations.
