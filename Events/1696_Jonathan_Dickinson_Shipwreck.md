# Jonathan Dickinson's Shipwreck: Survival Among the Jobe
## 1696

---

## Overview

In September 1696, the merchant ship Reformation wrecked on the Florida coast near present-day Jupiter, stranding 25 survivors including Quaker merchant Jonathan Dickinson, his wife Mary, their six-month-old son, and their enslaved people. What followed was a harrowing journey of survival as Spanish-allied Native Americans—the Jobe (Hobe) and Ais peoples—held them captive and marched them 230 miles north to St. Augustine. Dickinson's journal of the ordeal, published in 1699 as "God's Protecting Providence," became one of the most widely read accounts of colonial America, reprinted for over a century. Today, Jonathan Dickinson State Park near Jupiter preserves the landscape where this drama unfolded.
