# Edgar Watson: The Outlaw of the Ten Thousand Islands
## 1855-1910

---

## Overview

On October 24, 1910, the residents of Chokoloskee Island in Florida's remote Ten Thousand Islands did something they had been afraid to do for years—they shot and killed Edgar J. Watson, the most feared man in the Everglades frontier. Watson was a farmer, neighbor, husband, and probably a serial killer who allegedly murdered workers on his sugarcane plantation rather than pay them. His story—immortalized in Peter Matthiessen's novels *Killing Mister Watson*, *Lost Man's River*, and *Bone by Bone*—represents the lawless violence of Florida's last frontier, a place so remote that a man could commit murder with impunity until his neighbors took justice into their own hands.
