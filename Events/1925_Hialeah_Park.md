# Hialeah Park: The World's Most Beautiful Race Track
## 1925-2001

---

## Overview

For seven decades, Hialeah Park was the most glamorous horse racing venue in America—a Mediterranean Revival masterpiece where pink flamingos waded in the infield lake while society's elite watched thoroughbreds thunder past. Built in 1925 during the Florida land boom, Hialeah became the winter home of American horse racing, attracting the sport's greatest horses and wealthiest patrons. The Flamingo Stakes, the track's signature race, was the essential prep for the Kentucky Derby. Winston Churchill watched races there; Babe Ruth lost fortunes at the betting windows. When the track finally closed to racing in 2001, an era died with it, though the flamingos remained and the beautiful grounds still stand as a monument to a vanished world of elegance.
