# Marineland: The World's First Oceanarium
## 1938-Present

---

## Overview

When Marine Studios opened south of St. Augustine in 1938, it was designed not as a tourist attraction but as an underwater film studio—a place where Hollywood could shoot footage of marine life through giant portholes in concrete tanks. But the public was so fascinated that the facility quickly became one of Florida's most popular attractions, and the tourist industry discovered something powerful: people would pay to watch dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks swimming in captivity. Marineland invented the oceanarium concept and pioneered the captive dolphin industry, for better and worse. For decades it was Florida's premier marine attraction, until SeaWorld and other competitors overshadowed it. Today, the facility continues in diminished form, a living relic of an era when Florida's roadside attractions ruled.
