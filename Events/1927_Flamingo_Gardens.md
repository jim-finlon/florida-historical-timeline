# Flamingo Gardens: South Florida's Natural Heritage
## 1927-Present

---

## Overview

Flamingo Gardens in Davie preserves 60 acres of South Florida's vanishing natural landscape, including one of the last remaining native hammock forests in Broward County, along with botanical gardens, a wildlife sanctuary, and historic Wray Home Museum. What began in 1927 as a weekend retreat and citrus grove for Floyd and Jane Wray has evolved into one of Florida's most comprehensive attractions for experiencing the state's subtropical ecosystems and native wildlife. The gardens are home to the largest collection of Florida native wildlife, including flamingos, alligators, panthers, and birds of prey, offering an authentic Florida experience amid the region's rapid urbanization.
