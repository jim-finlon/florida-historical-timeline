# Florida Spring Training and Baseball Integration
## 1946-1961

---

## Overview

Florida has hosted Major League Baseball spring training since the early 1900s, becoming the sport's winter home. But for decades, Florida's Jim Crow laws meant that Black players—even after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947—faced segregation, discrimination, and humiliation during spring training. They couldn't stay in the same hotels as white teammates, eat in the same restaurants, or even drink from the same water fountains. The struggle to integrate Florida spring training was a crucial and often overlooked chapter in the civil rights movement, involving players like Jackie Robinson, Henry Aaron, and Frank Robinson, and continuing well into the 1960s. It revealed both the promise and the painful reality of desegregation in America.
