# Fort Lauderdale: From Seminole War Fort to Venice of America
## 1911-Present

---

## Overview

Fort Lauderdale, incorporated in 1911 on the site of a Seminole War fortification, has transformed from a tiny frontier settlement to South Florida's second-largest metropolitan area and a world-renowned tourism destination. Known as the "Venice of America" for its 300 miles of navigable waterways, Fort Lauderdale shed its raucous spring break reputation in the 1980s to become an upscale beach resort, major cruise port, and diverse metropolitan center. The city's growth parallels South Florida's explosive development, from Henry Flagler's railroad arrival to the boom-and-bust cycles that created modern Broward County.
