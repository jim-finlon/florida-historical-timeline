# Washington Oaks Gardens State Park: Where Gardens Meet the Sea
## 1936-Present

---

## Overview

Washington Oaks Gardens State Park, located on a barrier island between the Matanzas River and the Atlantic Ocean in Flagler County, combines formal ornamental gardens with one of Florida's most unusual beaches—a stretch of shore covered with coquina rock formations sculpted by centuries of wave action. Created in the 1930s by Owen D. Young, chairman of General Electric, and later expanded by his wife Louise, the gardens feature azaleas, camellias, bird of paradise, and native plants set among ancient live oaks. The Youngs donated the property in 1964, creating a state park that offers visitors a rare combination of cultivated beauty and wild, rocky coastline unlike anywhere else in Florida.
