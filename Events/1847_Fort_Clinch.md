# Fort Clinch: The Unfinished Fortress
## 1847-Present

---

## Overview

Fort Clinch on Amelia Island is one of the best-preserved 19th-century forts in the United States, a massive brick pentagonal fortress that took decades to build yet was never finished and never fired a shot in anger. Construction began in 1847 to guard the entrance to Cumberland Sound, continued sporadically through the Civil War (when it was occupied by both Confederate and Union forces), and was finally abandoned incomplete in 1869. Today, Fort Clinch State Park offers visitors the chance to explore the imposing brick fortification, watch living history programs with costumed interpreters, and enjoy one of Florida's most beautiful beaches on the state's northernmost barrier island.
