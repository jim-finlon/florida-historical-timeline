## Overview

The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in downtown St. Petersburg houses one of Florida's finest encyclopedic art collections, spanning nearly 5,000 years from ancient Egyptian artifacts to contemporary American photography. Founded in 1965 with a gift from collector Margaret Acheson Stuart, the museum occupies a waterfront location on Beach Drive that makes it one of the most beautifully situated museums in the American South. The collection's particular strengths in French Impressionism, American art, and photography, combined with significant European Old Masters and Asian art, offer visitors a comprehensive survey of world art history in an intimate, accessible setting.
