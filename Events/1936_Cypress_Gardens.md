# Cypress Gardens: Florida's First Theme Park
## 1936-2009

---

## Overview

Before Walt Disney arrived in Florida, before SeaWorld or Busch Gardens, there was Cypress Gardens—a botanical wonderland on the shores of Lake Eloise that opened in 1936 and pioneered the concept of the Florida theme park. Dick and Julie Pope created a Southern garden paradise with beautiful women in antebellum dresses, spectacular water-ski shows, and a brand of promotion so relentless that Cypress Gardens appeared in more than 50 films. For decades, Cypress Gardens was Florida's premier tourist attraction, the standard-bearer for the roadside attraction era, and the place where water skiing became a spectacle. Though the original park closed in 2009, its legacy lives on in the history of Florida tourism.
