# Bulow Plantation Ruins: The Sugar Empire That Vanished
## 1821-1836

---

## Overview

Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park preserves the haunting remains of what was once the largest sugar plantation in East Florida—a 4,675-acre estate where enslaved workers produced sugar, rum, and cotton until Seminole warriors burned it to the ground during the Second Seminole War. The ruins of the sugar mill, with its massive coquina walls and rusting machinery, stand as a monument to Florida's brief sugar boom and the violent conflicts that ended it. Located near Flagler Beach, the site offers a window into Florida's plantation era, the institution of slavery, and the devastating war that transformed the territory.
