# The Ancient Spanish Monastery: Medieval Europe in North Miami Beach
## 1141/1952-Present

---

## Overview

One of the most improbable structures in Florida is the Ancient Spanish Monastery in North Miami Beach—a medieval Cistercian cloister built in Sacramenia, Spain, in 1141 CE, purchased by William Randolph Hearst in 1925, dismantled stone by stone, shipped to America, and eventually reassembled in Florida. The monastery spent nearly 30 years in 11,000 numbered crates in a Brooklyn warehouse before entrepreneurs bought it, solved the puzzle of reassembly, and opened it in 1953 as a tourist attraction and working Episcopal church. Today, the 12th-century building is the oldest European-built structure in the Western Hemisphere and one of Florida's strangest historical sites.
