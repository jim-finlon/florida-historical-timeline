# Weeden Island Culture: The Mound Builders of the Gulf Coast
## 200-900 CE

---

## Overview

The Weeden Island culture flourished along Florida's Gulf Coast and throughout the Panhandle from approximately 200 to 900 CE, creating some of the most sophisticated and artistically accomplished pottery in prehistoric North America. Named for a shell midden site in Tampa Bay, Weeden Island peoples built elaborate burial mounds, developed complex mortuary rituals, and created distinctive effigy pottery with bird and animal motifs that archaeologists consider among the finest prehistoric art on the continent. This culture bridged the gap between earlier Hopewellian influences and the later Mississippian traditions, representing a critical period in Florida's prehistoric development.
