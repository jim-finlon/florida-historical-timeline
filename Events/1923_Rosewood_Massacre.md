# The Rosewood Massacre
## January 1-7, 1923

---

## Overview

In the first week of January 1923, a white mob destroyed the predominantly Black town of Rosewood, Florida, in Levy County. The violence began when a white woman in nearby Sumner claimed a Black man had assaulted her. Over the next week, white mobs from surrounding areas descended on Rosewood, burning homes and churches, hunting residents through the swamps, and killing an unknown number of people—officially six Black residents and two whites, though survivors believed the true death toll was much higher. The survivors fled and never returned; Rosewood ceased to exist. For decades, the massacre was covered up and forgotten, until survivors came forward in the 1980s, leading to a landmark state investigation and the first state compensation ever paid to victims of racial violence in American history.
