# Amelia Island: Eight Flags and a Thousand Stories
## 1562-Present

---

## Overview

Amelia Island at Florida's northeastern tip has flown under eight different flags—more than any other location in the United States—making it a unique crossroads of North American history. French, Spanish, British, Patriots, Green Cross of Florida, Mexican rebels, Confederate, and American flags have all waved over this barrier island, each chapter adding to its complex story. The Victorian seaport of Fernandina Beach preserves the last era's architecture, while the island's beaches and marshes keep older secrets. From Timucuan shell middens to shrimp boat fleets, Amelia Island encapsulates Florida's layered past.
