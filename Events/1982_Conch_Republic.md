# The Conch Republic: Key West's Tongue-in-Cheek Secession
## April 23, 1982

---

## Overview

On April 23, 1982, the mayor of Key West declared the island's independence from the United States, established the "Conch Republic," symbolically declared war on the U.S. by breaking a loaf of Cuban bread over the head of a man in a Navy uniform, surrendered one minute later, and immediately requested $1 billion in foreign aid. This absurdist political theater was a protest against a Border Patrol checkpoint that had been set up on U.S. 1, creating traffic jams and treating Keys residents like foreigners in their own country. The Conch Republic became a beloved symbol of Key West's quirky independence and continues as an annual celebration of the island's irreverent spirit.
