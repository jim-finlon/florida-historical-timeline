# The Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928
## America's Second-Deadliest Natural Disaster

---

## Overview

On September 16, 1928, a massive Category 4 hurricane struck the Palm Beach area and then passed over Lake Okeechobee, pushing a wall of water over the lake's earthen dikes and drowning thousands of people—mostly poor Black migrant workers—in the farming communities along the lake's southern shore. The official death toll was set at 1,836, but historians believe the actual number was 2,500 or higher, making it the second-deadliest natural disaster in American history after the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. The catastrophe led to the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike around Lake Okeechobee but also exposed the stark racial inequality in how victims were treated in death as in life.

## The Setting

### Lake Okeechobee

**The Lake:**
- Second-largest freshwater lake wholly within the United States
- Approximately 730 square miles
- But shallow—average depth only 9 feet
- "Liquid heart of Florida"

**The Danger:**
- Shallow lake = wind pushes water easily
- Southern shore particularly vulnerable
- Only earthen muck dikes for protection
- Dikes 4-6 feet high (inadequate)

### The Muck Lands

**The Agriculture:**
- Rich organic soil around the lake
- Drained swampland
- Sugarcane, vegetables
- Extremely productive

**The Workers:**
- Migrant farmworkers
- Predominantly African American
- Many from the Bahamas
- Lived in shacks near the fields

**The Towns:**
- Belle Glade, Pahokee, South Bay, Canal Point
- Small, poor communities
- Minimal infrastructure
- Black workers segregated from white residents

### Previous Warning

**The 1926 Moore Haven Disaster:**
- Hurricane pushed Lake Okeechobee water over western dikes
- Moore Haven flooded
- 300-400 killed
- But dikes on southern shore not improved

---

## The Storm

### The Approach

**September 1928:**
- Hurricane formed in Atlantic
- Devastated Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico
- 1,000+ dead in Puerto Rico alone
- Headed for Florida

**The Warnings:**
- Weather Bureau tracked the storm
- Warnings issued
- But many in isolated farming areas didn't receive them
- No radio, no telephone for most workers

### The Palm Beach Strike

**September 16, Early Evening:**
- Hurricane made landfall near Palm Beach
- Category 4 (estimated 145 mph winds)
- Devastating damage to coast
- Buildings destroyed, trees stripped

**Palm Beach County:**
- 26 dead on the coast
- Significant property damage
- Rich residents had some protection
- But storm continued inland

### The Lake Disaster

**The Horror:**
- Storm passed over Lake Okeechobee
- Pushed entire lake toward the south
- Water piled up against southern dikes
- Dikes collapsed

**The Flood:**
- Wall of water (estimates: 10-15 feet in places)
- Swept through farming communities
- Night darkness added to terror
- No time to escape

**Belle Glade, Pahokee, South Bay:**
- Towns inundated
- Shacks swept away
- People caught in fields, in homes
- Drowned in the dark

## The Victims

### Who Died

**The Farmworkers:**
- Primarily Black migrant laborers
- Many from the Bahamas
- Living in flimsy housing
- Most vulnerable
- Least warned

**The Numbers:**

| Official Count | Likely Actual |
|----------------|---------------|
| 1,836 | 2,500-3,000+ |

**Why the Discrepancy:**
- Many Black victims not counted
- Bodies decomposed before counting
- Some swept into Everglades, never found
- Transient workers often unnamed

### The Bodies

**The Horror:**
- Thousands of bodies scattered over miles
- Decomposition in Florida heat
- Identification often impossible
- Health emergency

**The Response:**
- Mass burials necessary
- Some bodies burned
- Burial parties worked for weeks
- Grim, overwhelming task

---

## The Racial Divide

### In Death as in Life

**The Burials:**
- **White victims:** Individual coffins, marked graves, funerals
- **Black victims:** Mass graves, often unmarked, burned or buried quickly

**The Numbers:**
- 674 victims buried in West Palm Beach mass grave (Black)
- 69 white victims given individual burials
- Separate in death as in life
- Jim Crow to the end

### The Mass Grave

**West Palm Beach:**
- Tamarind Avenue location
- 674 Black victims buried
- Mass grave, no individual markers
- For decades, unmarked

**The Memorial:**
- 2000: Site finally acknowledged
- Hurricane of 1928 Memorial Cemetery
- Marker placed
- Long overdue recognition

## Key People

### The Victims

**Unnamed Thousands:**
- Names largely lost to history
- Migrant workers from across the South
- Bahamian immigrants
- Families destroyed

### The Officials

**Governor John Martin:**
- Coordinated state response
- Requested federal help
- But limited resources

**President Calvin Coolidge:**
- Expressed sympathy
- Federal response limited
- But storm influenced flood control discussions

### The Investigators

**Later Historians:**
- Recovered stories of victims
- Documented racial disparities
- Pushed for memorials
- Restored memory

---

## The Response

### Immediate Aftermath

**The Crisis:**
- Bodies everywhere
- Infrastructure destroyed
- Disease threat
- Chaos

**The Relief:**
- Red Cross arrived
- National Guard deployed
- Supplies sent
- But scope overwhelming

### The Hoover Dike

**The Decision:**
- Federal government committed to Lake Okeechobee flood control
- Army Corps of Engineers tasked
- Massive project begun

**The Construction:**
- Herbert Hoover Dike (named for president who championed it)
- Surrounds the lake
- 143 miles of earthen dike
- 30+ feet high in places
- Completed 1930s-1960s

**The Result:**
- No repeat of 1928 disaster
- But dike itself now poses risks (aging, seepage)
- Ongoing maintenance
- Environmental concerns about lake management

## Significance

### For Florida

**Flood Control:**
- Led to massive water management system
- Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District
- Transformed the landscape
- Made agriculture safe (mostly)

**The Cost:**
- Everglades drainage accelerated
- Environmental damage
- Water management became political issue
- Lake Okeechobee health concerns today

### For Civil Rights History

**The Disparity:**
- Unequal treatment of dead starkly visible
- Black lives literally valued less
- Documented example of Jim Crow cruelty
- Later recognized and memorialized

**The Memory:**
- Zora Neale Hurston wrote about the hurricane in *Their Eyes Were Watching God*
- Storm became part of African American literature
- Memorial efforts restored memory
- History corrected

---

## In Literature

### *Their Eyes Were Watching God* (1937)

**Zora Neale Hurston:**
- African American writer, anthropologist
- Set climactic scenes of her novel during the 1928 hurricane
- Based on interviews with survivors
- Captured the horror and the injustice

**The Passage:**
> "The wind came back with triple fury, and put out the light for the last time. They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against crude walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His. They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God."

## Legacy

### The Memorial

**2003:**
- Hurricane of 1928 Memorial
- West Palm Beach
- Acknowledges the dead
- Lists what names are known

### The Lesson

**What the Storm Taught:**
1. Natural disasters don't discriminate, but society does
2. Poor and marginalized suffer most
3. Flood control requires massive investment
4. Memory must be preserved for all victims
5. Environmental engineering has consequences

### Ongoing Issues

**Lake Okeechobee Today:**
- Aging Herbert Hoover Dike
- Water quality problems
- Discharges to coasts cause algae blooms
- Balancing flood control, environment, agriculture
- 1928's lessons still relevant
