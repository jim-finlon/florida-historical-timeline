# The Key Marco Cat: Florida's Most Famous Artifact
## 1896

---

## Overview

In 1896, archaeologist Frank Hamilton Cushing made one of the most remarkable discoveries in American archaeology: a six-inch wooden carving of a half-human, half-cat figure preserved for nearly 1,000 years in the muck of a Florida island. The "Key Marco Cat," as it became known, was part of an astonishing find of wooden artifacts, masks, and ceremonial objects from the Calusa people, preserved in the waterlogged sediments of Key Marco (now Marco Island). The artifacts revealed an artistic sophistication that stunned the archaeological world and forever changed understanding of pre-Columbian Florida cultures. Today, the Key Marco Cat resides in the Smithsonian Institution, the symbol of a lost civilization and Florida's most famous archaeological treasure.
