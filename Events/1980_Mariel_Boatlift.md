# The Mariel Boatlift
## April 15 - October 31, 1980

---

## Overview

Between April and October 1980, approximately 125,000 Cubans fled their homeland in a massive exodus known as the Mariel Boatlift. Named for the port from which most departed, the boatlift was triggered when Fidel Castro unexpectedly announced that anyone wishing to leave Cuba could do so. Thousands of boats—many operated by Cuban Americans from Miami—crossed the Florida Straits to retrieve family members and others seeking freedom. The sudden influx transformed South Florida, overwhelming reception facilities and sparking both humanitarian outreach and political controversy. The Mariel boatlift represented the largest single migration from Cuba to the United States and permanently reshaped Miami's Cuban community.
