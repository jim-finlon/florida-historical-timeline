# Silver Springs: Florida's Original Tourist Attraction
## 1878-Present

---

## Overview

Long before Disney World, Sea World, or Universal Studios, there was Silver Springs. Located near Ocala, Silver Springs is one of the largest artesian springs in the world, pumping 550 million gallons of crystal-clear water daily. In 1878, Hullam Jones invented the glass-bottom boat here, creating one of America's first tourist attractions. For over a century, visitors gazed through those glass bottoms at the underwater paradise below, where visibility can reach 100 feet. Hollywood discovered Silver Springs in the 1930s, filming Tarzan movies, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and countless other productions in its waters. Silver Springs is Florida tourism before Florida tourism existed.
