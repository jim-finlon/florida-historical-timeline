# SeaWorld Orlando: From Marine Park to Conservation Campus
## 1973-Present

---

## Overview

SeaWorld Orlando, opened in 1973, pioneered the marine theme park concept in Central Florida and introduced millions of visitors to ocean life through entertainment, education, and animal encounters. Home to killer whales, dolphins, penguins, and countless marine species, SeaWorld has evolved significantly over its five decades, transitioning from theatrical animal shows toward a greater emphasis on roller coasters, conservation education, and animal rescue. As societal attitudes toward captive marine mammals have shifted, SeaWorld has transformed while remaining a major Central Florida attraction.
