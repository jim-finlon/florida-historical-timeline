## Overview

Marie Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota is the world's only botanical garden dedicated to the study and display of epiphytic plants—orchids, bromeliads, ferns, and other air plants that grow upon trees in tropical rainforests. Founded in 1973 on the 1936 bayfront estate of Marie and William Selby, the gardens have become an internationally acclaimed research institution with one of the world's most comprehensive collections of tropical plants, including over 6,000 orchids representing more than 3,000 species. The garden's stunning waterfront setting on Sarasota Bay, combined with its scientific mission and horticultural artistry, makes Selby one of Florida's most distinctive botanical treasures.
