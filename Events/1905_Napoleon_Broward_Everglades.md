# Napoleon Broward and the Draining of the Everglades
## 1905-1930s

---

## Overview

In 1905, Florida Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward launched one of the most ambitious and controversial environmental engineering projects in American history: the draining of the Everglades. Broward promised to turn the "worthless swamp" into productive farmland for settlers, and for decades, Florida dredged canals, built levees, and pumped water to reclaim the wetlands. The project succeeded in creating the Everglades Agricultural Area—some of the richest farmland in America—but at an enormous environmental cost. What seemed like progress in 1905 is now understood as ecological disaster, and billions of dollars are being spent to undo Broward's work. His legacy is written in the transformed landscape of South Florida.

## The Man

### Napoleon Bonaparte Broward

**Background:**
- Born April 19, 1857, Duval County, Florida

## The Everglades Before Drainage

### The Ecosystem

**The River of Grass:**
- 4,000 square miles of wetland
- Shallow, slow-flowing water
- Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay
- Unique ecosystem

**The Life:**
- Alligators and crocodiles
- Wading birds by the millions
- Panthers and bears
- Teeming with wildlife

### The Perception

**The "Swamp":**
- Seen as useless
- Breeding ground for mosquitoes
- Obstacle to development
- Wasted land

**The Potential:**
- Rich muck soil beneath water
- Could grow anything
- If only drained
- Florida's future

---

## The Campaign

### The Promise

**Broward's Vision:**
- "Water will run downhill"
- Simple engineering
- Drain the swamp
- Create farmland

**The Politics:**
- Appeal to settlers
- Land for the common man
- Fight against big landowners
- Populist message

### The Opposition

**The Skeptics:**
- Railroad interests
- Large landholders
- Some scientists
- Called it impossible

**The Internal Improvement Fund:**
- State land ownership
- Held Everglades in trust
- Broward wanted to use it
- Controversial

---

## The Drainage Project

### The Beginning

**1905:**
- Broward established Everglades Drainage District
- Constitutional amendment approved
- Funding authorized
- Dredges ordered

**The Method:**
- Dig canals
- Drain water to sea
- Lower water table
- Expose muck soil

### The Canals

**The System:**
- Miami Canal
- North New River Canal
- Hillsborough Canal
- Caloosahatchee Canal
- Connected Lake Okeechobee to Atlantic and Gulf

**The Work:**
- Steam dredges
- Thousands of workers
- Years of digging
- Massive project

### The Challenges

**The Reality:**
- More difficult than promised
- Expensive
- Progress slow
- Engineering problems

**The Scandals:**
- Land sales questioned
- Fraud allegations
- Political battles
- Broward died before completion (1910)

---

## After Broward

### Continued Drainage

**The Commitment:**
- Successive governors continued work
- Federal involvement
- Decades of effort
- Landscape transformed

**The 1920s:**
- Land boom fueled drainage
- More settlers wanted land
- Accelerated development
- Apparent success

### The Okeechobee Hurricane

**1928:**
- Hurricane broke Lake Okeechobee dike
- 2,500+ killed
- Worst natural disaster in Florida history
- Drainage had weakened natural barriers

**The Response:**
- Herbert Hoover Dike built
- Army Corps of Engineers took over
- Massive federal project
- Lake contained

### The Agricultural Area

**The EAA:**
- Everglades Agricultural Area created
- South of Lake Okeechobee
- Sugar cane, vegetables
- Some of richest farmland in America

---

## The Environmental Cost

### What Was Lost

**The Ecosystem:**
- Half of original Everglades destroyed
- Wildlife populations crashed
- Wading bird populations down 90%
- Unique habitat gone

**The Water:**
- Natural flow disrupted
- Water table lowered
- Salt water intrusion
- Supply endangered

### The Consequences

**The Discovery:**
- Everglades not "useless"
- Provided water filtration
- Flood control naturally
- Species habitat

**The Reckoning:**
- Marjory Stoneman Douglas's book (1947)
- Environmental awareness grew
- Damage recognized
- Restoration demanded

---

## The Restoration

### The Reversal

**The Plan:**
- Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP)
- Approved 2000
- $10+ billion project
- Undo Broward's work

**The Effort:**
- Remove canals
- Restore water flow
- Recreate wetlands
- Decades of work

### The Irony

**The Cost:**
- Billions to drain
- Billions to restore
- Broward's "progress" reversed
- Different understanding now

---

## Legacy

### For Florida

**The Transformation:**
- South Florida made habitable
- Agriculture enabled
- Development possible
- Modern Florida created

**The Price:**
- Environmental destruction
- Ongoing problems
- Water supply endangered
- Lessons learned

### For Broward County

**The Name:**
- County named for governor (1915)
- Fort Lauderdale area
- Irony: built on drained Everglades
- Living legacy

### For Environmental Policy

**The Lesson:**
- Engineering has limits
- Nature has value
- Unintended consequences
- Humility required
