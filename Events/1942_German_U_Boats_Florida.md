# German U-Boats Off Florida: The Secret War on America's Doorstep
## 1942-1943

---

## Overview

In the early months of 1942, German U-boats brought World War II to America's doorstep, prowling the waters off Florida's coast and sinking dozens of merchant ships within sight of shore. During Operation Paukenschlag (Drumbeat), submarines hunted silhouetted against the glow of Florida's coastal cities, whose lights remained ablaze despite the carnage offshore. In the first six months of 1942, more tonnage was sunk off the American East Coast than the U.S. Navy would lose in the entire Pacific war. Floridians watched helplessly as burning ships lit the night sky, oil-soaked survivors washed ashore, and bodies of merchant sailors piled up on their beaches. It remains one of the least-known chapters of the war.
