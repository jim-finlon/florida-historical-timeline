# Tarpon Springs: The Greek Sponge Capital of America
## 1905-Present

---

## Overview

In 1905, John Cocoris, a Greek sponge buyer, arrived in the small Florida town of Tarpon Springs and forever changed its destiny. Recognizing that the Gulf waters off the coast were rich with sponges—and that the local hook-and-pole harvesting method was primitive—Cocoris brought in Greek divers from the Dodecanese Islands who used traditional diving equipment to harvest sponges from the ocean floor. Within a decade, Tarpon Springs became the sponge capital of the United States, with over 500 Greek immigrants working the sponge boats. The Greek community that developed there created America's largest and most culturally intact Greek enclave, with authentic churches, traditions, and cuisine that persist to this day.
