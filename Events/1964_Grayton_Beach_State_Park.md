# Grayton Beach State Park: Florida's Most Beautiful Beach
## 1964-Present

---

## Overview

Grayton Beach State Park on the Emerald Coast of Florida's Panhandle protects one of the most stunning stretches of shoreline in the United States—sugar-white sand beaches framed by towering dunes, coastal dune lakes, and salt marshes. Repeatedly ranked as America's most beautiful beach, Grayton Beach showcases the unique geology of the Gulf Islands region, where quartz sand washed down from the Appalachian Mountains over millions of years creates beaches of dazzling whiteness. The park also features Western Lake, one of Florida's rare coastal dune lakes found almost nowhere else on Earth. Established in 1964, Grayton Beach remains one of the Panhandle's most treasured natural areas.
