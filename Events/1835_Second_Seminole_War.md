# The Second Seminole War: America's Longest Indian War
## 1835-1842

---

## Overview

The Second Seminole War (1835-1842) was the longest, most expensive, and bloodiest of the three wars fought between the United States and the Seminole people of Florida. Triggered by federal attempts to remove the Seminoles to Oklahoma under the Indian Removal Act, the war devolved into a brutal guerrilla conflict in the Florida swamps. Despite deploying over 30,000 troops and spending approximately $40 million, the United States could not defeat the Seminoles; instead, the war ended inconclusively, with most Seminoles removed but a defiant remnant remaining in Florida—unconquered and never surrendered.

## The Setting

### The Indian Removal Act (1830)

The war's roots lay in federal policy:

**The Act:**
- Signed by President Andrew Jackson
- Authorized negotiation of treaties for removal
- Native peoples east of Mississippi to be relocated to "Indian Territory" (Oklahoma)
- Applied to all southeastern tribes

**Jackson's Vision:**
- Complete separation of whites and natives
- Open southeastern lands to white settlement
- End conflicts by eliminating native presence

### Seminole Resistance

The Seminoles were determined to stay:

**Their Position:**
- Florida was their homeland
- Many had already been pushed here from elsewhere
- Oklahoma was unknown, distant, frightening
- Black Seminoles especially feared removal (would mean re-enslavement)

**Treaty of Payne's Landing (1832):**
- Some chiefs agreed to removal
- Others claimed they were tricked or coerced
- Deep divisions within Seminole leadership
- Many refused to recognize the treaty

### Rising Tensions (1832-1835)

As the removal deadline approached, conflict became inevitable:

**American Pressure:**
- Deadline for removal: 1835
- Military threats to force compliance
- Seminoles expected to gather at Tampa Bay for transport

**Seminole Preparation:**
- Osceola emerged as leader of resistance
- Warriors stockpiled weapons
- Planned attacks on American forces

## The War Begins

### The Dade Massacre (December 28, 1835)

The war's opening battle was a Seminole victory:

**The Situation:**
- Major Francis Dade led 108 soldiers from Fort Brooke (Tampa) to Fort King (Ocala)
- Eight-day march through Seminole territory
- Troops relaxed as they approached destination

**The Attack:**
- December 28, 1835
- Seminole warriors ambushed the column
- Fighting lasted all day
- Result: All but 3 soldiers killed (those 3 later died of wounds)
- Seminole losses: approximately 3 killed

**Significance:**
- Most devastating defeat of U.S. forces in an Indian war
- Demonstrated Seminole military capability
- Shocked the nation

### The Killing of Wiley Thompson

That same day, Osceola struck elsewhere:

**The Target:**
- Wiley Thompson: Indian Agent at Fort King
- Hated by Seminoles for his arrogance
- Had once had Osceola arrested and chained

**The Attack:**
- Osceola led a party to Fort King
- Caught Thompson and others outside the fort
- Thompson and four others killed
- Osceola reportedly took Thompson's scalp

### America's Response

The double strikes triggered full mobilization:

**Military Response:**
- Additional troops rushed to Florida
- Series of generals appointed to command
- War would consume military resources for seven years

**Public Reaction:**
- Outrage at Dade "massacre"
- Demands for revenge
- Underestimation of Seminole strength

## The War's Course

### American Strategy

The U.S. tried multiple approaches:

**Early Phase:**
- Conventional military operations
- Attempts to force decisive battle
- Seminoles refused to fight on American terms

**Middle Phase:**
- Scorched earth tactics
- Destroy villages, crops, and cattle
- Force Seminoles to surrender from starvation

**Late Phase:**
- Use of bloodhounds (controversial)
- Capture leaders under flags of truce (dishonorable)
- Gradual attrition

### Seminole Tactics

The Seminoles fought a guerrilla war:

**Their Approach:**
- Avoid large battles
- Ambush small units
- Attack supply trains
- Disappear into swamps and hammocks

**Their Advantages:**
- Knowledge of terrain
- Adapted to Florida's environment
- Highly motivated (fighting for survival)
- Black Seminole allies (excellent fighters)

**Their Challenges:**
- Limited supplies
- Unable to replace losses
- Families vulnerable to attack
- Constant pursuit left no rest

## The War's End

### Attrition, Not Victory

By 1842, both sides were exhausted:

**American Position:**
- War incredibly expensive ($40 million)
- Over 1,500 soldiers dead (mostly from disease)
- No end in sight
- Political pressure to stop the bleeding

**Seminole Position:**
- Most Seminoles had been captured or surrendered
- Perhaps 3,000 removed to Oklahoma
- Hundreds dead
- But a remnant remained, fighting on

### The Unofficial End

The war ended without a treaty:

**August 14, 1842:**
- Colonel Worth declared the war over
- Not a negotiated peace—just a decision to stop fighting
- Remaining Seminoles (200-300) allowed to stay in South Florida

**The Compromise:**
- Seminoles confined to remote swamplands
- No formal agreement
- Uneasy truce rather than peace
- Third Seminole War would erupt in 1855

## Significance

### Military Impact

The war taught costly lessons:

**For the Military:**
- Guerrilla warfare in difficult terrain was nearly impossible to win
- Conventional tactics failed against unconventional enemies
- Environmental challenges (disease, climate) killed more than combat

**Statistics:**
- U.S. troops deployed: over 30,000 (cumulative)
- U.S. dead: approximately 1,500 (most from disease)
- Cost: approximately $40 million (vast sum for the era)

### For the Seminoles

The war had devastating but not final consequences:

**Losses:**
- Approximately 3,000 removed to Oklahoma
- Unknown hundreds killed
- Villages, crops, livestock destroyed
- Society shattered

**Survival:**
- 200-300 remained in Florida
- Never surrendered, never signed treaty
- Retreated to Everglades and Big Cypress
- Ancestors of today's Seminole Tribe of Florida

### The Black Seminole Question

The war highlighted the slavery dimension:

**Central Issue:**
- Many Seminoles had African ancestry
- Escaped slaves had found refuge among Seminoles
- Return of these people to slavery was a war aim
- Black Seminoles fought especially fiercely—they had most to lose

**Outcome:**
- Many Black Seminoles were captured and enslaved
- Others were removed to Oklahoma (technically free but vulnerable)
- Some remained with Florida Seminoles
- The war was, in part, a slave-catching operation

## Legacy

- Never surrendered to the United States

The Second Seminole War:

- Longest and most expensive Indian war in U.S. history
- Demonstrated limits of American military power
- Showed the cost of Indian removal policies
- Produced future President (Zachary Taylor)
- Left unresolved issues that sparked Third Seminole War
