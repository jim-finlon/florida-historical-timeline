# Weeki Wachee Springs: Florida's Underwater Theater
## 1947-Present

---

## Overview

In 1947, a former Navy frogman named Newton Perry carved an underwater theater into the limestone walls of Weeki Wachee Springs, taught young women to breathe through air hoses while performing choreographed underwater ballet, and created one of Florida's most enduring and surreal tourist attractions. The Weeki Wachee mermaids—performing in crystal-clear 74-degree water against a backdrop of natural springs—became an iconic image of Florida's roadside attraction golden age. While other attractions closed, Weeki Wachee survived, became a state park in 2008, and continues to feature live mermaid performances in the oldest underwater theater in existence.
