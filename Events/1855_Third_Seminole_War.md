# The Third Seminole War: The Last Resistance
## 1855-1858

---

## Overview

The Third Seminole War was less a war than a hunt—the U.S. government's final attempt to remove the last few hundred Seminoles from Florida's wilderness. After the brutal Second Seminole War ended in 1842, a small band of Seminoles had been allowed to remain in the remote swamps south of Lake Okeechobee, on the condition that they stay hidden. But as white settlement pushed deeper into Florida, conflicts erupted, and in 1855, the army launched a campaign to capture or kill every remaining Seminole. The war ended inconclusively in 1858 when the government gave up, leaving perhaps 200 Seminoles in the Everglades—the ancestors of today's Seminole and Miccosukee tribes, the only Indians in America never to sign a peace treaty with the United States.
