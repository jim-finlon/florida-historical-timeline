# The Breakers: Palace of the Gilded Age in Palm Beach
## 1896-Present

---

## Overview

Rising from the Atlantic shore of Palm Beach like an Italian Renaissance palace, The Breakers is one of America's most legendary resort hotels and a monument to the Gilded Age extravagance of Henry Flagler. The current building, constructed in just eleven months after a fire destroyed its predecessor in 1925, features 538 rooms, frescoed ceilings painted by 75 Italian artisans, and grounds that have hosted presidents, royalty, and the cream of American society for over a century. Still owned by Flagler's descendants, The Breakers remains one of the few great American resort hotels still in family hands, a living link to an era when industrialists built private palaces and opened them to the public.
