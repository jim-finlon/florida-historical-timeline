# The Florida Reef Tract: America's Only Living Coral Barrier Reef
## 5,000 Years-Present

---

## Overview

The Florida Reef Tract, stretching 360 miles from the Dry Tortugas to St. Lucie Inlet, is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States and the third-largest barrier reef system in the world. This underwater treasure, located within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, supports over 6,000 species of marine life, protects the Keys from storm damage, and generates billions of dollars in tourism and fishing revenue. Formed over approximately 5,000 years as sea levels rose following the last ice age, the reef faces unprecedented threats from warming oceans, acidification, and disease. Its future is a matter of global ecological and economic concern.
