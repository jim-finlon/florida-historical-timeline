# Jackie Gleason and Miami Beach
## "The Sun and Fun Capital of the World"
## 1964-1987

---

## Overview

In 1964, Jackie Gleason—one of America's most beloved television comedians, star of *The Honeymooners*—moved his variety show from New York to Miami Beach, becoming the city's most famous booster and unofficial ambassador. For the next 22 years, *The Jackie Gleason Show* broadcast from the Miami Beach Auditorium to millions of viewers each week, opening every episode with "From the sun and fun capital of the world, Miami Beach!" Gleason's relocation helped transform Miami Beach's image from a winter resort for the elderly into a glamorous entertainment destination. The "Great One" became inseparable from Miami Beach's identity, and his influence on the city's culture and tourism lasted long after his death in 1987.
