# The Tallahassee Bus Boycott
## May 26, 1956 - January 1957

---

## Overview

On May 26, 1956, two Florida A&M University students, Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson, refused to give up their seats next to a white woman on a Tallahassee city bus. Their arrest sparked a seven-month bus boycott that became one of the most significant—yet least remembered—civil rights campaigns of the era. Beginning just months after the Montgomery Bus Boycott made Martin Luther King Jr. famous, the Tallahassee movement demonstrated that Black resistance to segregation was spreading across the South. Led by Rev. C.K. Steele and the Inter-Civic Council, the boycott ultimately forced the integration of Tallahassee's buses and established Florida as an active front in the civil rights struggle.
