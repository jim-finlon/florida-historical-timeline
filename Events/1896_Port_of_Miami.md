# The Port of Miami: Cruise Capital of the World
## 1896-Present

---

## Overview

From a muddy river mouth where Henry Flagler's workers docked supply barges, the Port of Miami has grown into the busiest cruise port in the world, sending millions of passengers annually to the Caribbean and beyond. The port's evolution mirrors Miami's rise from frontier town to global city, from the first commercial docks in 1896 to the construction of the artificial Dodge Island in the 1960s to today's massive cruise terminals serving the largest ships afloat. Beyond cruises, the "Cargo Gateway of the Americas" handles billions of dollars in trade with Latin America. The Port of Miami is not just infrastructure—it's the engine that drives South Florida's tourism economy and its connection to the hemisphere.
