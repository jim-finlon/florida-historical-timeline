# Jonathan Dickinson State Park: From Shipwreck to Sanctuary
## 1696/1950-Present

---

## Overview

Jonathan Dickinson State Park, stretching across 10,500 acres along the Loxahatchee River in Martin and Palm Beach counties, commemorates one of colonial Florida's most remarkable survival stories while protecting one of Southeast Florida's most important natural areas. Named for the Quaker merchant who survived a 1696 shipwreck and harrowing journey through Spanish Florida, the park preserves pine flatwoods, scrub habitat, and the federally designated Wild and Scenic Loxahatchee River—one of only two such rivers in Florida. The park also contains the historic Trapper Nelson homestead, the mysterious "Wildman of the Loxahatchee" who lived as a hermit along the river until his death in 1968.
