# Apalachicola: Oysters, Cotton, and a Forgotten Boom
## 1820s-Present

---

## Overview

Apalachicola, on Florida's Forgotten Coast, was once the third-largest port on the Gulf of Mexico, shipping more cotton than any port except New Orleans and Mobile. Today this small town of 2,300 is famous for a different harvest: Apalachicola Bay produces 90% of Florida's oysters and 10% of the nation's, thanks to the unique mix of fresh and salt water where the Apalachicola River meets the Gulf. The town's remarkable collection of antebellum architecture survives from its cotton boom days, and the John Gorrie State Museum honors the local physician who invented air conditioning while trying to cool his yellow fever patients. Apalachicola represents Florida's Gulf Coast before the beaches were discovered.
