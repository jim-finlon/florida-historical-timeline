# Florida Transferred to Britain
## 1763

---

## Overview

On February 10, 1763, the Treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years' War (known in America as the French and Indian War) and fundamentally reshaped the map of North America. Under its terms, Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba, which British forces had captured during the war. After nearly 200 years of Spanish rule, Florida would spend the next two decades as a British colony, divided into East and West Florida, before returning to Spain in 1783.

## The Setting

### The Seven Years' War (1756-1763)

The war that delivered Florida to Britain was truly global:

**Scope:**
- Fought on five continents
- Major powers: Britain vs. France (with allies on both sides)
- Spain entered late, allied with France

**In America:**
- British colonial forces fought French and their native allies
- Key battles in Canada and the Ohio Valley
- British ultimately victorious

**Spain's Entry (1762):**
- Spain joined France against Britain
- Hoped to limit British expansion
- Proved a costly mistake

### The Fall of Havana

Spain's defeat in Florida traced to events in Cuba:

**June 1762:**
- British fleet attacked Havana
- The most important Spanish port in the Americas

**August 1762:**
- Havana surrendered after two-month siege
- British captured enormous treasure
- Spain's Caribbean trade disrupted

**The Dilemma:**
- Spain desperately needed Havana back
- Britain demanded compensation
- Florida became the price

## The Treaty of Paris (1763)

### Negotiations

The treaty was negotiated among Britain, France, and Spain:

**British Position:**
- Victor in the war, demanded territorial gains
- Wanted French Canada
- Desired secure colonial frontiers
- Willing to trade Havana for Florida

**Spanish Position:**
- Must recover Havana at any cost
- Florida was isolated, expensive, and strategically secondary
- Preferred trading Florida to losing Cuba forever

**French Position:**
- Losing vast territories in Canada and elsewhere
- Ceded Louisiana to Spain as compensation for Spanish losses

### Key Terms (Regarding Florida)

**The Exchange:**
- Britain returned Havana to Spain
- Spain essentially traded Florida for Havana

**Other Terms:**
- France ceded Canada to Britain
- France ceded Louisiana (west of Mississippi) to Spain

## The Story

### End of Spanish Florida

For nearly 200 years, Florida had been Spanish:

**What Spain Had Built:**
- St. Augustine: the administrative capital
- Pensacola: the western outpost
- A network of missions among native peoples
- Cultural, religious, and economic ties across generations

**What Was Lost:**
- All of it—territory, investments, history
- Spain received no compensation except Havana's return
- Nearly two centuries of colonial effort abandoned

### The Spanish Exodus

When news of the transfer reached Florida, the Spanish population faced a choice:

**The Options:**
1. Stay and become British subjects (few chose this)
2. Leave for Spanish territories elsewhere

**The Departure:**
- Virtually the entire Spanish population chose to leave
- Most went to Cuba
- Some went to Mexico or other Spanish colonies
- Churches, government records, and valuables were packed and shipped

**The Numbers:**
- St. Augustine's population before: approximately 3,000
- Population after Spanish departure: virtually empty
- Pensacola experienced similar exodus

**The Last Floridians:**
- The final Spanish ships left in 1764
- With them went the last indigenous mission Indians
- Only 89 natives—the survivors of once-great nations—sailed for Cuba
- They were the last of Florida's original peoples

### British Arrival

British forces and officials arrived to take possession:

**Military:**
- British troops occupied the Castillo de San Marcos (renamed Fort St. Mark's)
- Garrisons established at Pensacola and St. Augustine

**Administration:**
- Governor appointed for each colony
- British legal system introduced
- Protestant worship permitted (reversing Catholic exclusivity)

**The Empty Land:**
- British found towns nearly deserted
- Buildings abandoned or in disrepair
- Native populations devastated by disease and displacement
- An empty canvas for new colonial development

## The British Floridas

### Division into Two Colonies

Britain divided Florida into two separate colonies:

**East Florida:**
- **Territory:** Atlantic coast and peninsula
- **Capital:** St. Augustine
- **Governor:** First governor was Francis Grant, followed by James Grant (who served 1764-1771)
- **Character:** More developed; focused on plantation agriculture

**West Florida:**
- **Territory:** Gulf coast from the Apalachicola River to the Mississippi
- **Capital:** Pensacola
- **Governor:** First governor was George Johnstone
- **Character:** More frontier; focused on trade with natives

### Why the Division?

**Practical Reasons:**
- The territory was too large to administer as one unit
- St. Augustine and Pensacola were separated by wilderness
- Communication between them was difficult
- Different challenges required different approaches

**Precedent:**
- Britain had divided other large territories
- Carolina had been split into North and South Carolina
- Two colonies meant two governors, two assemblies, two administrative systems

## Development Under British Rule

### Population Growth

British Florida attracted new settlers:

**East Florida by 1783:**
- Population grew from near zero to approximately 17,000
- Included British settlers, Loyalist refugees, and enslaved Africans
- Many came from the Carolinas and Georgia

**Sources of Settlement:**
- British planters from other colonies
- Immigrants recruited from Europe
- Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution (after 1775)
- Large enslaved population brought for plantation labor

### Economic Development

British colonists transformed the economy:

**Plantation Agriculture:**
- Large plantations established along rivers
- Crops: indigo, rice, cotton, sugar cane
- Enslaved labor formed the economic foundation

**New Smyrna Colony:**
- Dr. Andrew Turnbull recruited 1,400 Minorcan, Greek, and Italian colonists (1768)
- Largest single immigration to British North America
- Indigo plantation venture
- Colony failed; survivors fled to St. Augustine (1777)
- Minorcan descendants remain in St. Augustine today

**Trade:**
- Commerce with Britain and other colonies
- Trade with remaining native populations
- Export of timber, naval stores, and agricultural products

### The Revolution in Florida

Unlike the Thirteen Colonies, Florida remained loyal to Britain:

**Loyalty:**
- Few settlers with revolutionary sympathies
- Recent arrivals grateful for land grants
- Loyalists fleeing rebel colonies reinforced loyalty
- Strong military presence discouraged dissent

**As Loyalist Refuge:**
- Thousands of Loyalists fled to East Florida
- Population swelled with refugees
- Brought enslaved people and whatever property they could save
- St. Augustine became a Loyalist stronghold

**Military Activity:**
- Florida served as base for British raids into Georgia
- Some Patriot incursions into Florida
- Mostly minor skirmishing

## Significance

### Historical Pivot

The 1763 transfer marked a turning point:

**End of First Spanish Period:**
- 198 years of Spanish presence ended
- Spanish Florida's cultural legacy remained but was submerged
- The mission system had already collapsed

**Brief British Experiment:**
- Only 20 years of British rule
- But significant development in that short time
- Introduction of plantation agriculture and English common law

**Foundation for American Florida:**
- British land grants would influence later property claims
- English-speaking settlers established
- American orientation of Florida began

### The Loyalist Legacy

Florida's role in the Revolution had lasting effects:

**Population:**
- Loyalists brought Anglo-American culture
- Many would stay even after return to Spain
- English became entrenched alongside Spanish

**Slavery:**
- Massive expansion of enslaved population
- Plantation system established
- Would define Florida's economy through the Civil War

### Return to Spain (1783)

British rule was brief:

**Treaty of Paris (1783):**
- Different treaty, same name
- Ended the American Revolution
- Spain (which had entered the war against Britain) received Florida back
- Britain lost interest after losing the American colonies

**The Second Exodus:**
- Many British settlers left for the Bahamas or elsewhere
- But many stayed, becoming Spanish subjects
- Florida would never again be purely Spanish

## Legacy

### What Changed

Twenty years of British rule left permanent marks:

1. **English language** established alongside Spanish
2. **Plantation agriculture** introduced
3. **New population** with different cultural orientation
4. **Property system** based on British land grants
5. **Seeds of American** (rather than Spanish) identity

### What Remained

Some continuity persisted:

1. **St. Augustine** continued as capital
2. **Castillo de San Marcos** (Fort St. Mark's) still stood
3. **Basic geography** of settlement unchanged
4. **Challenges** of climate, distance, and native relations continued

### Looking Forward

The 1763 transfer was the first of three regime changes Florida would experience:

| Year | Change |
|------|--------|
| 1763 | Spain to Britain |
| 1783 | Britain to Spain |
| 1821 | Spain to United States |

Each transfer reshaped Florida, but the 1763 change began Florida's transformation from Spanish colonial outpost to eventual American state.
