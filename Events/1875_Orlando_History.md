# Orlando: The City Beautiful
## 1875-Present

---

## Overview

Orlando, incorporated in 1875 as a small cattle town in Central Florida's lake-dotted interior, has transformed into one of America's fastest-growing metropolitan areas and the theme park capital of the world. Yet Orlando's story extends far beyond Disney and Universal—from its origins as a frontier settlement and citrus hub, through its role in the space race and military aviation, to its emergence as a major convention destination, technology center, and diverse international city. "The City Beautiful" has evolved from a sleepy Southern town of 10,000 in 1940 to a booming metropolis of over 2.5 million in its metro area.
