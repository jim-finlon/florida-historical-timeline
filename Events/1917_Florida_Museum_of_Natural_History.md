## Overview

The Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida in Gainesville is the largest natural history museum in the southeastern United States and one of the nation's leading research museums. Founded in 1917 as the Florida State Museum, the institution houses more than 40 million specimens and artifacts documenting the natural and cultural history of Florida and beyond. From the Butterfly Rainforest—a living exhibit featuring free-flying butterflies—to world-class research collections in paleontology, archaeology, and biodiversity, the Florida Museum combines public education with cutting-edge scientific research in a facility that has served as Florida's natural history resource for over a century.
