# Glazer Children's Museum: Tampa's Learning Playground
## 2010-Present

---

## Overview

The Glazer Children's Museum, opened in 2010 in downtown Tampa's Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, brings hands-on learning to life for the youngest residents and visitors of the Tampa Bay region. Named for the Glazer family whose philanthropy made the museum possible, this 53,000-square-foot facility features a dozen themed exhibit zones where children can pilot a ship, engineer a building, create art, and explore the workings of their own community. The museum's prominent waterfront location alongside the Tampa Museum of Art and Tampa Bay History Center creates a cultural campus that anchors Tampa's revitalized downtown.
