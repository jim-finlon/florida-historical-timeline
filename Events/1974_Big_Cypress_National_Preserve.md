# Big Cypress National Preserve: The Everglades' Wild Neighbor
## 1974-Present

---

## Overview

Big Cypress National Preserve, established in 1974, protects 729,000 acres of subtropical swamp—the critical freshwater source that feeds the western Everglades. Unlike national parks, this national preserve allows traditional uses including hunting, off-road vehicle access, and oil extraction, reflecting the compromise required to protect this vast wilderness. The preserve harbors Florida panthers, black bears, and the last wild places where the Seminole and Miccosukee peoples still live traditionally. From the cypress-dome landscapes of the interior to the mangrove coast where the Everglades meet the Gulf, Big Cypress represents Florida's largest and wildest protected area north of Everglades National Park.
