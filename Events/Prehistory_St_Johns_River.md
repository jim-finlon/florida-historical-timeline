# The St. Johns River: Florida's Nile
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

The St. Johns River is one of the few rivers in North America that flows north, winding 310 miles from its headwaters near Vero Beach to its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean in Jacksonville. For over 6,000 years, it has been the central artery of human life in northeastern Florida—home to the ancient St. Johns archaeological culture, highway for Native Americans, route for European explorers, battleground of colonial wars, and economic engine of modern Florida. The river's unusual characteristics—flowing north, almost no gradient, connecting vast wetlands—made it unique among American waterways and central to Florida's development.
