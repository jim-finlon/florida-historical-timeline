# The University of Florida: From Seminary to Flagship
## 1853-Present

---

## Overview

The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the state legislature established the East Florida Seminary, making it one of the oldest universities in the American South. Through mergers, relocations, and transformations, this modest school evolved into Florida's flagship public university, one of the largest and most comprehensive in the nation. The 1905 consolidation of several state institutions in Gainesville created the modern university, which has grown from 102 students to over 55,000, from a few buildings to a campus of more than 2,000 acres. UF's story parallels Florida's transformation from frontier state to modern powerhouse.
