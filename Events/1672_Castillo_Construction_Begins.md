# Construction of the Castillo de San Marcos Begins
## 1672

---

## Overview

On October 2, 1672, Spanish workers laid the first stones of the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, Florida, beginning a construction project that would take over two decades to complete. Built of locally quarried coquina stone—a remarkable material that would prove nearly impervious to cannon fire—the Castillo became the most formidable fortress in colonial North America. It would protect St. Augustine through sieges, wars, and regime changes, and it stands today as the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States.

## The Setting

### Why a Stone Fort?

The decision to build the Castillo came after more than a century of failed defenses:

**Previous Forts:**
- Nine wooden forts had been built in St. Augustine since 1565
- Each had succumbed to rot, fire, hurricanes, or enemy attack
- Wood was plentiful but impermanent
- The 1668 pirate raid by Robert Searle proved the town's vulnerability

**The Threat:**
- English pirates operated freely in Florida waters
- Carolina (founded 1670) put aggressive English colonists nearby
- Native attacks remained a concern
- St. Augustine's strategic importance demanded better protection

**The Solution:**
- A permanent stone fortification
- Strong enough to resist cannon fire
- Large enough to shelter the entire population
- Impressive enough to deter attack

## The Material: Coquina

### What Is Coquina?

The Castillo's success depended on an unusual building material:

**Composition:**
- Coquina (Spanish for "tiny shells") is a sedimentary rock
- Composed of millions of compressed shell fragments
- Bound together naturally over thousands of years
- Looks like solidified sand mixed with shells

**Location:**
- Quarried from Anastasia Island, across the bay from St. Augustine
- Abundant deposits made it accessible
- Local sourcing reduced cost and transport time

**Properties:**
- Soft when first quarried (could be cut with hand tools)
- Hardened when exposed to air
- Remarkably resistant to cannon fire
- Cannonballs would embed in the soft stone rather than shatter it
- Could be repaired relatively easily

**Discovery:**
- Spanish had known about coquina for decades
- Initially dismissed as too soft
- Engineers finally recognized its potential for fort construction

## The Construction

### Design

The Castillo followed Spanish military engineering principles:

**Shape:**
- Star-shaped trace with four diamond-shaped bastions
- Design maximized defensive firepower
- Eliminated blind spots where attackers could hide
- Similar to Spanish forts throughout the empire

**Dimensions:**
- Walls: approximately 12 feet thick at the base
- Height: approximately 33 feet
- Curtain walls connected the four bastions
- Central courtyard with rooms for storage, barracks, and ammunition

**Features:**
- Moat (originally dry, later flooded)
- Drawbridge entrance
- Gun deck for artillery
- Living quarters and storage vaults
- Well for fresh water
- Chapel within the walls

### The Workforce

Building the Castillo required enormous labor:

**Workers:**
- Spanish soldiers (required to contribute labor)
- Convict laborers
- Indigenous workers from the missions
- Enslaved Africans
- Skilled craftsmen from Spain and Mexico

**Organization:**
- Master engineers designed the structure
- Overseers managed work crews
- Specialized masons cut and fitted coquina blocks
- Laborers quarried, transported, and lifted stone

**Conditions:**
- Brutal work in Florida's heat and humidity
- Workers suffered from disease and exhaustion
- Many died during the construction
- Work continued despite hardships

### Timeline

Construction proceeded slowly but steadily:

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1672 | Groundbreaking (October 2) |
| 1675 | Foundation and lower walls complete |
| 1680 | Walls near completion; first guns mounted |
| 1687 | Major construction essentially complete |
| 1695 | All planned work finished |
| 1756 | Major expansion (outer works added) |

**Duration:**
- Primary construction: 23 years (1672-1695)
- Total cost: approximately 138,375 pesos (enormous sum for the era)

## The Story

### Laying the First Stone

On October 2, 1672, Governor Manuel de Cendoya presided over the ceremony that marked the beginning of construction. The governor, flanked by soldiers and priests, watched as workers positioned the first coquina blocks on the prepared foundation. Prayers were offered, and the project was blessed in the name of the Spanish Crown.

For the people of St. Augustine, the moment was laden with significance. They had lived for over a century in the shadow of wooden walls that could neither resist cannon fire nor survive Florida's hurricanes. Now, at last, they would have a fortress worthy of the oldest European city in what would become the United States.

### Years of Labor

The construction site dominated St. Augustine life for a generation. Every morning, boats carried workers across the bay to Anastasia Island, where they quarried coquina blocks from the pits. The soft stone was cut with hand saws and picks, loaded onto barges, and ferried back to the construction site.

At the Castillo site itself, skilled masons shaped and fitted the blocks. Mortar made from lime, sand, and shell was mixed and applied. Block by block, layer by layer, the walls rose from the marshy shore.

The work was dangerous and exhausting. Florida's summers brought crushing heat and humidity. Mosquitoes spread disease. Workers collapsed from heat stroke and fever. The missions were depleted as indigenous laborers died or fled. Enslaved Africans bore much of the heaviest work.

Yet the walls continued to rise.

### A Fortress Takes Shape

By the early 1680s, the basic structure was complete enough to mount cannon on the walls. The garrison moved into the finished sections, finally protected by walls that could resist attack. But work continued on the interior, the outworks, and the finishing touches that would take another fifteen years.

When complete, the Castillo de San Marcos was unlike anything else in North America:

- Its coquina walls could absorb cannon fire that would shatter conventional stone
- Its star-shaped bastions provided interlocking fields of fire
- Its moat and drawbridge denied easy access
- Its massive structure could shelter St. Augustine's entire population
- Its appearance alone deterred attack
