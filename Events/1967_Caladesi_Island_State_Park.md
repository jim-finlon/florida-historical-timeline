# Caladesi Island State Park: Florida's Unspoiled Barrier Island
## 1967-Present

---

## Overview

Caladesi Island State Park, accessible only by boat or a walk across neighboring Honeymoon Island, preserves one of the few completely undeveloped barrier islands remaining on Florida's Gulf Coast. Located off Dunedin in Pinellas County, the island features three miles of pristine beach, a mangrove kayak trail, and a maritime hammock interior untouched by roads or bridges. Frequently ranked among America's top beaches, Caladesi offers what much of Florida's coastline once looked like—wild, natural, and free from the condominiums and hotels that line most of the state's shores. The island's isolation has made it a sanctuary for wildlife and a treasured escape for visitors seeking authentic Gulf Coast nature.
