# Myakka River State Park: Florida's Wild Heart
## 1941-Present

---

## Overview

Myakka River State Park, one of Florida's oldest and largest state parks at nearly 58 square miles, protects a vast expanse of wetlands, prairies, hammocks, and pine flatwoods along the wild Myakka River in Sarasota County. Established in 1941 from land acquired during the Depression, the park offers visitors an authentic Florida wilderness experience—from airboat rides across Upper Myakka Lake to walking the nation's first canopy walkway high in the treetops. The park's diverse ecosystems support one of Florida's largest concentrations of alligators, extensive bird populations, and the endangered Florida sandhill crane. Myakka represents what much of Florida looked like before development, a window into the state's natural heritage.
