# Edison, Ford, and the "Mystic River": Fort Myers' Famous Winter Residents
## 1885-1947

---

## Overview

In 1885, Thomas Alva Edison—the most famous inventor in the world—discovered the sleepy village of Fort Myers on Florida's southwest coast and decided to build a winter home and laboratory there. For the next four decades, Edison spent winters in Florida, conducting experiments and enjoying the subtropical climate. In 1916, his close friend Henry Ford purchased the property next door, and for the next two decades, the two titans of American industry wintered as neighbors, often joined by fellow luminaries like Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs. Their presence transformed Fort Myers from an obscure frontier town into a winter destination, and their estates remain among Florida's most visited historical sites.
