# Mel Fisher and the Atocha: The World's Greatest Treasure Hunt
## 1969-1985

---

## Overview

On July 20, 1985, after a 16-year search that cost him his son, daughter-in-law, and nearly everything he owned, treasure hunter Mel Fisher found the "Mother Lode" of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Señora de Atocha—$450 million in gold, silver, and emeralds lying on the seafloor 40 miles off Key West. The Atocha had sunk in a 1622 hurricane while carrying the wealth of the New World back to Spain. Fisher's relentless quest, fought against the ocean, the state of Florida, and the federal government, became a symbol of persistence and the enduring allure of sunken treasure. Today, the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West displays the glittering finds, and treasure hunting continues in Florida waters.
