# Sarasota School of Architecture: Florida's Modernist Movement
## 1941-1966

---

## Overview

The Sarasota School of Architecture was a regional modernist movement that flourished on Florida's Gulf Coast from the 1940s through the 1960s, creating buildings perfectly adapted to the subtropical climate through innovative use of glass, natural ventilation, and indoor-outdoor living spaces. Led by architects including Paul Rudolph, Ralph Twitchell, Victor Lundy, and Gene Leedy, the movement produced homes, schools, and public buildings that earned international recognition and influenced modern architecture worldwide. Though many buildings have been lost to development, the surviving structures represent an important chapter in American architectural history and continue to inspire contemporary Florida design.
