# Addison Mizner: Architect of the Florida Dream
## 1918-1933

---

## Overview

In 1918, a flamboyant, self-taught architect named Addison Mizner arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, and proceeded to invent the architectural vocabulary of Florida's Gold Coast. Drawing on Spanish, Moorish, and Mediterranean influences, Mizner created a romantic style—"Mediterranean Revival"—that came to define Florida's image of elegant luxury. His villas for the wealthy along the Palm Beach coast, and later his ambitious development of Boca Raton, established an aesthetic that Florida has never abandoned. From Worth Avenue's pink arcades to the red-tiled roofs visible throughout South Florida, Mizner's vision shapes how the world pictures Florida.
