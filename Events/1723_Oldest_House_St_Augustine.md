# The Oldest House: St. Augustine's González-Alvarez House
## c. 1723-Present

---

## Overview

The González-Alvarez House, known simply as "The Oldest House," is the oldest surviving Spanish colonial dwelling in Florida and one of the oldest houses in the United States. Located on St. Francis Street in St. Augustine, the coquina stone structure has stood since approximately 1723, witnessing Spanish, British, Spanish again, and American rule. Archaeological excavations beneath the house have revealed artifacts dating to the early 1600s, confirming continuous habitation on the site for over 400 years. Owned and operated by the St. Augustine Historical Society since 1918, the house and its museum complex tell the story of ordinary people who lived through extraordinary times in America's oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement.
