# José Martí and the Cuban Revolution in Florida
## 1891-1895

---

## Overview

In the 1890s, the father of Cuban independence made Florida his revolutionary headquarters. José Martí—poet, philosopher, and revolutionary—organized Cuban exiles in Tampa's Ybor City and Key West, raising money, building political support, and planning the armed struggle that would free Cuba from Spanish rule. Florida's Cuban cigar workers became the financial backbone of the revolution, contributing their wages to the cause. Martí's tireless organizing in Florida laid the groundwork for the war that would eventually bring Cuban independence—and draw the United States into the Spanish-American War. His legacy connects Florida forever to Cuban history.
