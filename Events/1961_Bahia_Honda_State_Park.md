# Bahia Honda State Park: The Florida Keys' Most Beautiful Beach
## 1961-Present

---

## Overview

Bahia Honda State Park, located on a 524-acre island 37 miles south of Marathon in the Florida Keys, is consistently rated as having one of the best beaches in the United States—and the best in Florida. The park's sandy shores, rare in the rocky Keys, are fringed by remarkably clear waters and backed by tropical hardwood hammocks containing plants found nowhere else in the continental United States. The historic Bahia Honda Rail Bridge, built by Henry Flagler's Overseas Railroad, arches over the deep channel and offers visitors a dramatic walk above the turquoise waters. Established as a state park in 1961, Bahia Honda preserves a unique Keys ecosystem while providing world-class snorkeling, camping, and beach experiences.
