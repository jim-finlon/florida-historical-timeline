# Fort Matanzas: Spain's Sentinel on the Inlet
## 1565/1742-Present

---

## Overview

Fort Matanzas National Monument preserves both a small but significant Spanish watchtower fort and the site of one of the bloodiest episodes in Florida's colonial history. The name "Matanzas"—Spanish for "slaughters"—commemorates the 1565 massacre of over 200 French Huguenots by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, an act that secured Spanish control of Florida. The coquina fort, built in 1742, guarded the southern approach to St. Augustine through Matanzas Inlet. Today, visitors can ferry to the tiny island to explore this remarkably intact colonial fortification, one of the few surviving Spanish forts in North America.
