# The Salvador Dalí Museum: Surrealism Comes to St. Petersburg
## 1982-Present

---

## Overview

The Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg holds the world's most comprehensive collection of works by Spanish Surrealist master Salvador Dalí—over 2,400 objects including 96 oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, and sculptures spanning his entire career. The collection was assembled by Ohio industrialists A. Reynolds and Eleanor Morse over four decades of friendship with the artist. When the Morses sought a permanent home for their treasures, an unlikely Florida city won the prize. The current museum building, opened in 2011, is itself a work of art—a striking structure designed to withstand hurricanes while embodying Dalí's own aesthetic. Today, the museum draws visitors from around the world to experience one of the 20th century's most influential artists in an unexpected Florida setting.
