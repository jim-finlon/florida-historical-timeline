# Invasive Species in Florida: The Ecological Invasion
## 1980s-Present

---

## Overview

Florida faces one of the most severe invasive species crises in the United States, with non-native plants and animals disrupting ecosystems from the Everglades to the Florida Keys. The subtropical climate, global trade through busy ports, the exotic pet industry, and the aquarium and landscaping trades have combined to make Florida a hotspot for biological invasion. From Burmese pythons decimating Everglades mammals to lionfish ravaging reef fish populations, invasive species cost Florida billions of dollars and threaten the native wildlife that makes the state unique.

## History

### Early Invasives

**Pre-1980s:**
- Brazilian pepper spread
- Melaleuca introduction
- Water hyacinth invasion
- Agricultural pests

### Modern Crisis

**1980s-Present:**
- Python establishment
- Lionfish explosion
- Tegu population growth
- Accelerating introductions
