# Whitehall: Henry Flagler's Palm Beach Palace
## 1902-Present

---

## Overview

When Henry Flagler gave his third wife Mary Lily Kenan a wedding present, he gave her a palace. Whitehall, completed in 1902, was a 75-room Gilded Age mansion that the New York Herald called "more wonderful than any palace in Europe." For the decade before his death in 1913, Flagler entertained the elite of American society in its marble halls, making Palm Beach the winter capital of the American aristocracy. After decades as a hotel, Whitehall was saved from demolition and opened as the Flagler Museum in 1960, offering visitors a glimpse into the world of the man who invented modern Florida and the opulent lifestyle of America's Gilded Age.
