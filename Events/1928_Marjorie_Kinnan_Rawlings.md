# Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and Cross Creek
## 1928-1953

---

## Overview

In 1928, a struggling writer named Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings bought a ramshackle orange grove in the remote Florida scrub near Cross Creek and found her voice. Over the next two decades, she would write the books that defined Florida's rural interior to the world, culminating in *The Yearling* (1938), which won the Pulitzer Prize and became an American classic. Rawlings immersed herself in the lives of the "Cracker" families around her, hunting, fishing, and farming alongside them while crafting prose of extraordinary lyrical beauty. Her home at Cross Creek is now a state park, and her books remain the definitive literary portraits of old Florida—a vanishing world she captured before it disappeared.
