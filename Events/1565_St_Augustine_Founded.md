# The Founding of St. Augustine and the Destruction of Fort Caroline
## September 1565

---

## Overview

In September 1565, Spanish admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés accomplished two interconnected objectives that would shape Florida's history for centuries: he founded St. Augustine, the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, and he destroyed the French Huguenot colony at Fort Caroline, massacring most of its inhabitants. These events—the establishment of a town that endures to this day and the bloody elimination of Spain's Protestant rivals—mark the true beginning of European colonization of North America.

## The Setting

### Spain's Urgent Response

The news of Fort Caroline had alarmed King Philip II of Spain:

**The Threat:**
- French Protestants on Spanish territory
- Danger to treasure fleet passing Florida's coast
- Heretics spreading their faith to native peoples
- Challenge to Spain's monopoly in the Americas

**The Solution:**
- Send a powerful fleet to eliminate the French
- Establish permanent Spanish settlements
- Secure La Florida once and for all

### Pedro Menéndez de Avilés

The king chose his most capable naval commander:

**Background:**
- **Born:** February 15, 1519, in Avilés, Asturias, Spain
- **Career:** Rose from sailor to Spain's premier admiral
- **Experience:** Commanded treasure fleet convoys
- **Personal motivation:** His son had been shipwrecked off Florida; Menéndez hoped to find him

**Character:**
- Brilliant strategist and administrator
- Ruthless in pursuit of objectives
- Devout Catholic
- Utterly loyal to the Spanish Crown

**The Contract (Asiento):**
- Menéndez signed on March 20, 1565
- Agreed to conquer and colonize Florida at his own expense
- Would receive titles, land, and monopolies in return
- The king provided ships, soldiers, and artillery

## The Spanish Expedition

### The Force

Menéndez assembled a formidable armada:

**Ships:**
- 19 vessels of various sizes
- Largest Spanish fleet yet sent to Florida

**Personnel (approximately 2,600):**
- 1,500 soldiers and sailors
- 500 settlers (farmers, craftsmen, families)
- 200 sailors for permanent colony
- Priests and religious personnel
- Enslaved Africans

**Supplies:**
- Food for one year
- Tools and building materials
- Weapons and ammunition
- Livestock and seeds

### The Voyage

**June 29, 1565:** Departed Cádiz, Spain
**August 28, 1565:** Sighted Florida coast (feast day of St. Augustine of Hippo)
**September 4, 1565:** Encountered French ships at the River of May

---

## The Story

### First Contact with the French

Menéndez arrived knowing exactly where the French were. On September 4, his fleet encountered French ships at the mouth of the St. Johns River (River of May). A tense confrontation ensued.

**The Encounter:**
- Spanish ships challenged the French
- Menéndez demanded the French identify themselves
- When told they were French under the French King, Menéndez declared he would pursue and destroy them
- The French ships—faster and more maneuverable—escaped southward

Menéndez could not catch the French ships, so he turned to his backup plan: establish a base to the south before attacking Fort Caroline by land.

### Founding of St. Augustine

On September 6, 1565, Menéndez's fleet entered a harbor about 40 miles south of Fort Caroline. The site offered:

- A protected inlet
- Fresh water
- Timucua village (Seloy) willing to host the Spanish
- Strategic position between Fort Caroline and the sea

**September 8, 1565:** Menéndez formally founded the settlement:

- Named it San Agustín (St. Augustine) for the saint on whose feast day he had first sighted Florida
- Celebrated Mass—the first Catholic Mass in what would become the United States
- Took formal possession in the name of King Philip II
- Began fortifying the position immediately

**The First Days:**
- Spanish occupied the Timucua town of Seloy
- Converted the chief's great house into a temporary fort
- Soldiers began digging trenches and earthworks
- Women and non-combatants were landed from the ships

### The French Response

At Fort Caroline, Jean Ribault learned of the Spanish arrival:

**Ribault's Decision:**
- Rather than defend Fort Caroline, he chose to attack
- Loaded soldiers onto the French ships
- Planned to destroy the Spanish fleet before it could threaten the colony
- Left Fort Caroline lightly defended

**The Hurricane:**
- As Ribault's fleet sailed south toward St. Augustine, a massive storm struck
- The French ships were driven southward along the coast
- Several ships wrecked on the beaches south of St. Augustine
- Ribault and his men were stranded, scattered along miles of coastline

### The March to Fort Caroline

Menéndez saw his opportunity. With the French fleet destroyed by the storm and their best soldiers stranded far to the south, Fort Caroline was vulnerable.

**September 16, 1565:**
- Menéndez led approximately 500 soldiers overland toward Fort Caroline
- Marched through swamps and forests in driving rain
- Native guides showed the way

**The Conditions:**
- Terrible weather (the hurricane was still affecting the region)
- Men slogged through water up to their waists
- Many wanted to turn back
- Menéndez pushed forward relentlessly

**September 20, 1565:**
- Spanish forces reached Fort Caroline at dawn
- Found the fort lightly guarded
- Most defenders were asleep

### The Massacre at Fort Caroline

What followed was slaughter:

**The Attack:**
- Spanish troops stormed the fort from multiple directions
- Guards at the gates were killed before they could raise the alarm
- Soldiers burst into barracks, killing men as they stumbled from their beds

**The Killing:**
- Approximately 132-142 French killed at Fort Caroline
- Menéndez ordered that no Protestants be spared
- Women and children under 15 were taken prisoner (approximately 50-70)
- Some French escaped by boat or into the woods

**Survivors:**
- Laudonnière escaped, wounded, by boat
- Artist Jacques Le Moyne also escaped
- Approximately 50 colonists reached the French ships in the river and eventually made it back to France

**Renaming:**
- Menéndez renamed the captured fort San Mateo (St. Matthew)
- Left a garrison to hold it
- Returned to St. Augustine

### The Massacre at Matanzas Inlet

But the killing was not finished. Two weeks later, even greater slaughter occurred:

**The Situation:**
- Ribault and his shipwrecked men were stranded south of St. Augustine
- They faced impossible choices: march through hostile wilderness, surrender, or die of starvation

**First Group (September 29, 1565):**
- Approximately 200 French survivors approached St. Augustine seeking rescue
- Menéndez met them at an inlet (now called Matanzas)
- After brief negotiations, the French surrendered
- They were ferried across the inlet in small groups
- Once across, their hands were bound
- They were led behind sand dunes and killed

**Second Group (October 11, 1565):**
- Ribault himself, with approximately 350 men, reached the same inlet
- Menéndez again demanded surrender
- About 150 French (mostly Catholics and skilled craftsmen) were spared
- Ribault and approximately 200 others were executed in the same manner

**The Name:**
- The inlet became known as Matanzas—Spanish for "slaughters"
- The name endures to this day

### The Final Toll

**Total French Dead:**
- Fort Caroline: 132-142
- Matanzas (first massacre): approximately 111
- Matanzas (second massacre): approximately 200
- Additional deaths from shipwrecks, starvation, native attacks: unknown
- **Total: approximately 450-500 killed**

**French Survivors:**
- Approximately 50 escaped from Fort Caroline
- Approximately 150-200 spared at Matanzas (Catholics, craftsmen)
- Prisoners (women, children): 50-70
- Jean Ribault: killed
- Laudonnière: escaped to France
- Jacques Le Moyne: escaped to England

## Significance

### Oldest Continuously Occupied City

St. Augustine holds a unique place in American history:

- **Founded:** September 8, 1565
- **Continuous occupation:** Over 450 years
- **Predates:** Jamestown (1607) by 42 years; Plymouth (1620) by 55 years
- **Status:** Oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the United States

### End of French Florida

The destruction of Fort Caroline ended French colonization in Florida:

- France would not attempt another Florida settlement
- French colonial efforts shifted to Canada and the Caribbean
- Spain controlled La Florida for the next two centuries

### Religious Warfare in the New World

The massacres shocked even contemporaries used to religious violence:

- Menéndez explicitly killed the French as Protestants, not just as enemies
- The religious dimension made the killings especially brutal
- French Protestants martyred at Matanzas became symbols
- In 1568, French Catholic Dominique de Gourgues attacked San Mateo in revenge, killing the Spanish garrison

### Spanish Florida Established

With the French eliminated, Menéndez built a colonial system:

- **St. Augustine:** Administrative capital and military base
- **Santa Elena (South Carolina):** Northern outpost (1566)
- **Missions:** Established among Timucua, Guale, and Apalachee
- **System:** Combined military posts, missions, and native alliances
