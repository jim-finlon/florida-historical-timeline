# Mary McLeod Bethune: Florida's Educator and Civil Rights Pioneer
## 1904-1955

---

## Overview

In 1904, Mary McLeod Bethune arrived in Daytona Beach, Florida, with $1.50 in her pocket and a vision to educate Black children. Starting with five little girls in a rented room, she built the Daytona Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls, which would eventually become Bethune-Cookman University. But Bethune's impact extended far beyond education: she became one of the most influential African Americans of the twentieth century, founding the National Council of Negro Women, advising four U.S. presidents, and serving in Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration as the highest-ranking Black woman in government. From her base in Florida, she shaped national civil rights policy and inspired generations of leaders.
