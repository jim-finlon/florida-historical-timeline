## Overview

Busch Gardens Tampa Bay has transformed from a small hospitality garden attached to an Anheuser-Busch brewery in 1959 into one of North America's premier theme parks, renowned for world-class roller coasters and one of the country's largest zoological collections. The African-themed park spans 335 acres and combines heart-pounding thrill rides like SheiKra, Cheetah Hunt, and Iron Gwazi with habitats housing over 12,000 animals.
