# Ten Thousand Islands: Florida's Labyrinth of Mangroves
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

The Ten Thousand Islands, sprawling across the southwestern tip of the Florida peninsula where the Everglades meet the Gulf of Mexico, comprise one of the largest undeveloped mangrove estuaries in North America—a maze of approximately 10,000 islands, keys, and oyster bars spread across 35,000 acres of protected wilderness. This labyrinthine waterscape, once home to the Calusa and later the domain of outlaws and pioneers, now shelters endangered species, world-class fishing, and some of Florida's most remote backcountry. Part of Everglades National Park and the Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge, this region remains one of the last truly wild places in Florida, accessible only by boat and navigable only by those who know its secrets.
