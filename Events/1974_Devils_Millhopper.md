# Devil's Millhopper: The Prehistoric Sinkhole
## Prehistory-Present

---

## Overview

Devil's Millhopper is a spectacular 120-foot-deep sinkhole in Gainesville that provides a window into millions of years of Florida's geological and biological history. Named for its funnel shape—like the hopper of a mill that feeds grain to grinding stones—the sinkhole harbors a unique rainforest microclimate where ferns, liverworts, and plants normally found in Appalachian gorges thrive in its perpetually cool, moist depths. Shark teeth, whale bones, and marine fossils embedded in its walls testify to the time when Florida lay beneath ancient seas. A 232-step stairway descends to the bottom, where visitors experience a landscape unlike anything else in Florida.
