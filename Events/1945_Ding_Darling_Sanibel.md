# J.N. "Ding" Darling and Sanibel Island
## 1945-Present

---

## Overview

Jay Norwood "Ding" Darling was a Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist who became one of America's most influential conservationists—and who fell in love with Sanibel Island off Florida's Gulf Coast. As head of the U.S. Biological Survey in the 1930s, Darling created the Federal Duck Stamp program, expanded the national wildlife refuge system, and fought to protect wetlands across America. On Sanibel, he led the effort to preserve the island's remarkable wildlife habitat, ultimately resulting in the creation of the refuge that now bears his name. Today, the J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge protects over 6,400 acres of mangrove habitat, seagrass beds, and tropical forest, making Sanibel one of America's great birding destinations.
