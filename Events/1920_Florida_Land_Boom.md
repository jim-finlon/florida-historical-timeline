# The Florida Land Boom
## 1920-1926

---

## Overview

In the early 1920s, Florida experienced the most spectacular real estate boom in American history. Land that sold for dollars an acre became worth thousands, then tens of thousands. Fortunes were made overnight as speculators bought and sold "binders" on properties they'd never seen. Developments with Mediterranean names rose from swamps and sand. Miami's population tripled, new cities sprang from nothing, and everyone—from bellhops to millionaires—joined the frenzy. Then, just as suddenly, it ended. By 1926, the bubble had burst, bankrupting thousands and leaving half-built developments across the state. The Florida land boom and bust foreshadowed the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression, demonstrating how quickly speculative fever could turn to economic disaster.
